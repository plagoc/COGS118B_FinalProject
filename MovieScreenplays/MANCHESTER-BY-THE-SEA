MANCHESTER BY THE SEA

Written & Directed 

by

Kenneth Lonergan

EXT. MANCHESTER HARBOR -- SEA. DAY.

A small commercial fishing boat heads out of Manchester, 
Massachusetts, toward the open sea. JOE CHANDLER, late 30s, 
is in the wheelhouse. In the stern are LEE CHANDLER, Joe’s 
younger brother by five years, and Joe’s son PATRICK, about 9 
years old. Lee and Patrick are kidding around in a friendly 
way while Joe steers.

SEVEN YEARS LATER -- THE PRESENT

EXT. BOSTON -- QUINCY -- APARTMENT HOUSE. DAY.
It’s a cold winter day on a narrow street. 
In front of a small apartment building, LEE sweeps away the 
old snow on the pavement, then sprinkles salt in front of the 
building. He is 40 now, wearing janitor’s coveralls under his 
weatherbeaten winter jacket.

INT. BATHROOM. DAY.

Lee works on a leaky toilet while MR MARTINEZ, 50s, a big man 
in an undershirt and glasses, stands by watching.

MR MARTINEZ

I don’t know why the hell it keeps 
dripping. All night long, drip, 
drip. I’ve had the fucking thing 
repaired ten times.

LEE

You need a new stopper.

MR MARTINEZ

Oh is that it?

LEE

See how it’s rotted around the 
edges? It doesn’t make a seal, so 
the water drips into the bowl. I 
can bring you a new one tomorrow, 
or you might want to consider 
replacing the whole apparatus.

MARTINEZ

What do you recommend?

Lee starts putting away his tools and cleaning up.

2.

LEE

Well, I could replace the stopper 
first, and if that doesn’t work, 
then I would come back and replace 
the whole apparatus.

MARTINEZ 

But you don’t have a professional 
recommendation?

LEE

It’s really up to you.

MARTINEZ

Well, tomorrow I got my sister-in-
law coming over with my nephews 
...and I gotta take my car in...

Lee waits while Mr Martinez works out his schedule.

INT. BASEMENT. DAY.
He organizes the trash cans and recycling in the basement.

INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY. DAY.
He vacuums the hall with an industrial vacuum cleaner on a 
fifty foot yellow extension cord.

EXT. QUINCY -- ANOTHER BUILDING. DAY.

A different apartment building on a similar street.

INT. MRS GROOM’S APARTMENT. DAY.
Standing on a ladder in a small grandmotherly apartment, Lee 
changes a light bulb in the very small bathroom. MRS GROOM, 
70s, is on the phone outside the open bathroom door.

MRS GROOM

(On the phone)

No, it’s my sister Janine’s oldest 
girl’s bat mitzvah...No, I look 
forward to being bored to death... 
No, the girl doesn’t want it, the 
father doesn’t want it. I don’t 
ask. Seven hours in the car, I 
could really slit my throat...Oh, 
well, the little girls are 
charming. 

3.

EXT. QUINCY -- A SLIGHTLY MORE UPSCALE STREET. DUSK.
A marginally more upscale building.

INT. BATHROOM. DUSK.
Lee looks down at a stopped-up toilet. Behind him is 
MARIANNE, slender, 30s, attractive, wearing everyday around-
the-house clothes. 

I am so sorry. This is so gross.

MARIANNE

It’s all right.

LEE

He plunges her toilet carefully and methodically. 
LATER -- He wipes up the floor. Marianne comes in.

MARIANNE

Oh Lee, you don’t have to do that, 
honestly.

That’s OK.

LEE

MARIANNE

Well -- God. Thank you so much, I 
am so sorry.

LATER -- He is washing his hands in her bathroom sink. He 
hears Marianne talking on the phone O.C.

MARIANNE (CONT’D)

No, tell him to come! ... Okay, 
yeah ... But Cindy, I have to tell 
you something. I'm like, in love 
with my handyman. Is that sick? ... 
Have you ever had a sexual fantasy 
about your handyman? ... Well, it's 
awkward because he is literally 
like, cleaning the shit out of my 
toilet bowl right now. And I don't 
think I'm at my most alluring ... 
Yeah, maybe you're right. It's not 
like I met him socially ... Okay 
thank you Cindy. You’re a really 
good friend ... OK like twenty 
minutes. ‘Bye!

IN HER SMALL LIVING ROOM -- He comes out of the bathroom. 
Marianne is now dressed up to go out. She looks great.

4.

All set.

LEE

MARIANNE

Thank you so much. Can I give you a 
tip?

You mean, like a suggestion?

LEE

MARIANNE

(Taking out a ten)

No -- I mean -- like, a tip...

LEE

That’s all right. Have a good 
night.

Oh, please. I’d feel bad.

MARIANNE

LEE 

(Takes the money)

OK, thanks a lot. Good night.

Good night! And thank you so much.

MARIANNE

INT. MRS OLSEN’S BATHROOM. DAY.
Lee is down on his hand and knees. MRS OLSEN, 40s, in a 
bathrobe, is very good-looking but bad-tempered and nervous.

MRS OLSEN

How many times do we have to fix 
these fucking pipes? Every time I 
take a shower their entire 
apartment has a flood. It’s driving 
me insane.

LEE

I’ll bring the plumber tomorrow but 
I’d say we’re gonna have to break 
through the tile and try to isolate 
the leak, because there was quite a 
lot of water --

MRS OLSEN

But how do you know it’s me? Why is 
it automatically me? 

LEE

Because if it was coming from 
higher up you’d have water damage 
on the ceiling too, and maybe in 
your wall, and it’s all dry. 

5.

Great.

MRS OLSEN

Lee looks at the bathtub.

LEE

It might just be the caulking. This 
whole tub needs to be re-caulked. 
Did you take a bath or shower in 
the last couple of hours?

Yes...

MRS OLSEN

LEE

Well, it could actually just be 
that.

MRS OLSEN

OK.  And how are you planning to 
find that out?
LEE

Well, we could turn on the shower 
and see if it drips downstairs...

You want me to take a shower now?

MRS OLSEN

No...

LEE

MRS OLSEN

You want me to take a shower while 
you stand there watching, to see if 
the water drips down into the 
Friedrich’s apartment?

LEE

I don’t really give a fuck what you 
do, Mrs. Olsen. I just want to find 
the leak. 

Mrs Olsen goes white with shock and fury. 

MRS OLSEN

No, you can get out of my apartment 
and don’t ever come back. 

OK.

LEE

MRS OLSEN (CONT'D)

How dare you fucking talk to 
me like that? Get the fuck 
out of my house before I call 
the police!

You’re blockin’ the doorway.

LEE

6.

INT. MR EMERY’S OFFICE. NIGHT.
The building manager’s office. MR EMERY is in his 50s. Lee 
sits in the chair before the crowded desk. 

EMERY

What the fuck’s matter with you? 
You can’t talk to the tenants like 
that!

Lee shrugs. 

EMERY (CONT’D)

Look, Lee. You do a good job. 
You’re dependable. But I get these 
complaints all the time. You’re 
rude, you’re unfriendly, you don’t 
say good mornin’. I mean come on!

LEE

Mr Emery, I fix the plumbing. I 
take out the garbage. I paint their 
apartments. I do electrical work -- 
which we both know is against the 
law. I show up on time, I’m workin’ 
four buildings and you get all the 
money. So do whatever you’re gonna 
do. 

EMERY

Would you be willin’ to apologize 
to Mrs Olsen?
LEE

For what? 

EMERY

All right, all right, I’ll talk to 
her.

Lee gets up to go.

INT. A LOUD QUINCY BAR. NIGHT.
Lee drinks alone at a small, crowded neighborhood bar.
AT THE BAR -- Lee is waiting for service. Someone bumps a 
CUTE GIRL, 30s, into him. She spills some beer on Lee. 

GIRL

Oh my God, I’m sorry! Did I 
get you? Yeah. Lemme get a 
napkin. Lenny, could I get a 
couple of napkins? (Gives Lee 
some napkins.) Here you 
are...

That’s OK. I’m OK...

LEE

7.

Thanks.

LEE (CONT’D)

GIRL

Well, now I spilled beer all over 
you, my name’s Sharon.

That’s OK.

LEE

GIRL
And you are...
LEE

Lee.

She gets the message that he is not interested. He pats 
himself dry, not looking at her.

LATER -- 
The bar is far less packed. We see SHARON across the room, 
talking to a girlfriend. At the bar, Lee is drinking alone. 
He’s pretty drunk by now. He is looking at two BUSINESSMEN, 
40s. One of them notices and mentions it to the other. They 
look at him for a moment then ignore him. He gets up and 
walks toward them. They are surprised at his approach. 

How you doin’?

1ST BUSINESSMAN

2ND BUSINESSMAN

How you doin’?
LEE

Good. I’m good. Can I ask you guys, 
have we met before?

The two men look at each other then back at Lee.

I don’t think so.

1ST BUSINESSMAN

I don’t think so either.

2ND BUSINESSMAN

So you guys don’t know me?

LEE

1ST BUSINESSMAN

2ND BUSINESSMAN

No, Yeah. No. Do we?

No...
No.

LEE

Well then what the fuck are you 
lookin’ at me for?

8.

Excuse me?

2ND BUSINESSMAN

LEE

I said why the fuck are you lookin’ 
at me?

1ST BUSINESSMAN
Sir, we really weren’t 
looking at you --  

           BARTENDER

2ND BUSINESSMAN

Hey! Take a fuckin’ walk. Hey 
-- Paul -- No -- don’t 
apologize to this asshole-- 
(To LEE) Take a hike!

(Hurrying over)
Hey, Lee...Lee...!
Lee HITS the 2nd Businessman and knocks him into a wall. 
Several pictures fall and smash on the floor. 

Oh, goddamnit -- 

BARTENDER

Lee punches the 1st Businessman’s nose. He falls back and 
grabs his face, blood streaming from both nostrils. The 2nd 
Businessman and Lee swipe at each other. 

1ST BUSINESSMAN

2ND BUSINESSMAN

You broke my fuckin’ nose!
The BARTENDER leaps over the bar and grabs Lee from behind -- 
Other guys join in to break it up.

Goddamn lunatic --

BARTENDER

Lee! Lee! Lee! Enough! 
LEE

VARIOUS VOICES

Break it up! Break it up!

Lemme go. I gotta go take a hike.

General melee.

INT. LEE’S BASEMENT APARTMENT. NIGHT.
Lee turns the light on and comes in. He is a little roughed 
up from the fight.
At his dresser, Lee pulls on sweatpants and an undershirt. 
There are THREE FRAMED PHOTOS in imitation silver frames 
standing on the little dresser. We don’t see the photos.
Lee sits on the sofa with a beer and turns the TV on to a 
late-night sports program. Slowly he falls asleep. The can in 
his hand tips slowly sideways and spills onto the sofa.

9.

EXT. LEE’S STREET. DAY.
It’s snowing. Lots of slow, heavy flakes, very pretty. 

EXT. LEE’S BUILDING -- WINTER. DAY. 
Lee is shoveling snow. The air is clear and cold. The whole 
street is beautified by the recent snow storm. His iPhone 
rings. He takes off his gloves. Digs out the phone.

LEE

Hello ... This is Lee ... Oh ... 
When did that happen? ... Well, how 
is he? ... OK. Uh...No. Don’t do 
that. I’ll come up right now ... 
OK. Thank you.

He hangs up and goes inside with the shovel, leaving the snow 
before the building only partially cleared and salted down.

INT. LEE’S CAR (MOVING). DAY.
Lee sits behind the wheel, trying to get out of Boston and 
onto Rt 1. North. He’s talking on his iPhone.

LEE

(Into his iPhone)

Mr Emery, it’s Lee again. I 
contacted Jose, who says he can 
cover for me til Friday night at 
least, and then Gene MacAdavey can 
take over till I get back. I’ll be 
in Manchester at least a week or 
two. I’ll call again when I have 
more information. Goodbye. 

He hangs up and drives into increasingly heavy traffic.

Come on, come on.

LEE (CONT’D)

The traffic slows. He becomes increasingly anxious.

EXT. RT. 128 -- LEE’S CAR (MOVING). DAY.
Lee’s car takes the exit for Beverly.

EXT. BEVERLY HOSPITAL. DAY.
Lee drives through the grounds of a big modern hospital. He 
knows exactly where he’s going. He parks and gets out. He 
walks quickly to the main entrance, then breaks into a run.

10.

INT. BEVERLY HOSPITAL. DAY.
We lead/follow Lee as he walks quickly through the halls 
toward the ICU, easily navigating the twists and turns from 
habit. He goes into the ICU --

INT. ICU -- NURSE’S STATION -- CONTINUOUS. DAY. 
-- and approaches GEORGE, around 50, a big weatherbeaten guy, 
and NURSE IRENE, 40s. They both react as Lee approaches. 

Hiya, Lee.

GEORGE

Is he dead? 

LEE

George’s eyes fill with tears. He makes a helpless gesture. 

NURSE IRENE

I’m sorry, Lee. He passed away 
about an hour ago.

Oh.

LEE

I’m so sorry. 

NURSE IRENE

Lee looks at the floor, hands on his hips. Nurse Irene gives 
his arm an awkward squeeze. Lee stares into the middle 
distance for a moment.

LEE

Did you see him? 
GEORGE

Yeah. I mean -- No -- 
NURSE IRENE

George br --

GEORGE (CONT'D)

I brought him in.

GEORGE (CONT’D)

...We were lookin’ at the boat this 
mornin’, and he just -- I don’t 
know, he just, like, fell over. I 
thought he was kiddin’ me at first. 
Then I called the ambulance ...and 
uh -- that was it.

Lee shakes his head, still staring at the floor. 

NURSE IRENE
I’ll just call Dr Muller and tell 
him that you’re here. 

11.

Where’s Dr Betheny?

LEE

NURSE IRENE

Oh, she’s on maternity leave. Oh 
here he is. 

DR MULLER, 40s, has just joined them.

DR MULLER

Lee? I’m Dr Muller. We spoke on the 
phone.

Yeah. Hi.

LEE

I’m very, very sorry. 

DR MULLER

Thank you.

LEE

Hello, George.

DR MULLER

He shake hands with George.
GEORGE

Hiya Jim.

DR MULLER
How you holding up?

Oh -- Great! You know.

GEORGE

Well...it’s a very sad day. 

DR MULLER

Yeah. 

GEORGE

George starts to cry. He looks down and wipes his eyes. 

Where’s my brother?  

LEE

DR MULLER

He’s downstairs. You can see him if 
you want.

LEE
What happened?

12.

DR MULLER

Well, you know his heart was very 
weak at this point, and it just 
gave out. If it’s any comfort, I 
don’t think he suffered very much. 
I’m sorry you didn’t get here in 
time, but as I told you on the 
phone --

LEE

Aw, fuck this. (He looks at the 
floor. Long pause. He looks up.)
Sorry.
DR MULLER

That’s perfectly all right.

GEORGE
That’s OK, buddy. 

Did anybody call my Uncle?

LEE

DR MULLER and GEORGE glance at each other.

Their Uncle Donny.

GEORGE

LEE

Yeah, my Aunt and Uncle. 
Somebody shoulda called them. 
What?

GEORGE (CONT'D)

No, Lee -- Lee, no --

Minnesota?

GEORGE (CONT’D)

-- Donny got a job in Minnesota, 
like --
LEE

GEORGE (CONT'D)

-- awhile ago. Yeah: He got a 
job with some outfit in 
Minnetonka, Minnesota, if you 
can believe that. Joe didn't 
tell you about that?

No.

LEE

GEORGE

I can call ‘em if you want, Lee. 
And tell ‘em what happened.

LEE
OK. Thanks...

13.

LEE (CONT’D)

Tell ‘em...Tell ‘em what 
happened. Tell ‘em I’ll call 
‘em tonight, probably 
tomorrow. Talk about 
arrangements.

GEORGE
Oh, no problem --

Sure, I can do that.

GEORGE (CONT’D)

And somebody better call my wife.
There is a confused, embarrassed hesitation.

LEE

DR MULLER

Your...
LEE

Ex-wife. Yes. Sorry.
I meant Randi.

GEORGE

You mean Randi? 
That's OK -- I already 
thought of that. I'll take 
care of it.

OK, thanks.

LEE

No problem.

GEORGE

Can I see him now?

LEE

Sure.  

DR MULLER

GEORGE

Lee -- I can wait up here, Lee, in 
case you need anything.

OK.

LEE

Dr Muller leads Lee away. George breaks down again.

I'm sorry.

GEORGE

Would you like a Kleenex?

NURSE IRENE

Thanks. Yeah.

GEORGE

INT. HOSPITAL ELEVATOR. 
Dr Muller and Lee ride down very slowly.

14.

How is Dr Betheny?

LEE

DR MULLER

Oh, she's doing very well. She just 
had twin girls.

Oh yeah. Irene told me. 

LEE

DR MULLER 

Apparently weigh about eleven 
pounds apiece. So she's gonna have 
her hands full for a while...I’ll 
call her this afternoon and tell 
her what happened.

She was very good to him. 

LEE

Yes she was.

DR MULLER

EIGHT YEARS AGO --

INT. JOE CHANDLER’S HOSPITAL ROOM. DAY.
JOE CHANDLER is lying in the hospital bed. There’s a close 
resemblance between him and Lee.
ELISE, Joe’s wife, the same age as Joe, pretty, anxious and 
high-strung -- stands near to STANLEY CHANDLER -- Lee and 
Joe’s father, 70s. He sits in one chair. LEE sits in another. 
They are all listening to DR BETHENY, 30s. She is small, 
intense, very serious and focused and level-headed, but 
thoroughly well-meaning and decent. 

DR BETHENY

The disease is commonly referred to 
as congestive heart failure --

Oh my God!

ELISE

Are you familiar with it?

DR BETHENY

No...!

ELISE

15.

JOE

Then what are you sayin’ “Oh my 
God” for? 

Because what is it?

ELISE

JOE 

She’s tryin’ to explain it to us, 
honey. I’m sorry, Dr Beth...uh...

Betheny: 

DR BETHENY 

JOE

I’m sorry. I can never get it 
right.

DR BETHENY (CONT'D)

Don’t worry about it. Not a 
problem. 

So, you were saying, Dr Beth.

STAN

It’s Dr Betheny, Dad. 

JOE

LEE

Dr Betheny, Daddy, try to get 
it right..

It’s a comedy routine!

ELISE

Would you let her tell it? 

JOE

STAN
Elise, please...

ELISE

Oh my God: When am I gonna put one 
foot right? 

Honey, for Christ’s sakes!

JOE

How about a hint?

ELISE

Stanley takes Elise’s hand and holds onto it.

STAN

Elise...Sweetheart...Let’s just let 
her explain the situation to us...

Daddy...

LEE

STAN

What? She's fine. We're all upset. 
We're all gonna listen, then we're 
gonna ask everything we wanna ask, 
and then we’re gonna figure out 
what do to, together. Right?

16.

Right.

JOE

DR BETHENY 

It's a gradual deterioration of the 
muscles of the heart. It’s usually 
associated with older people, but 
in rarer cases it will occur in a 
younger person. Some people can 
live as long as fifty or sixty 
years with just an occasional 
attack. But most people suffer 
periodic episodes, like the one you 
had on Monday, which mimic the 
symptoms of a heart attack and 
which further weaken the muscle. 
They can put you out of commission 
for a week, two weeks. And you’ll 
need to be hospitalized so we can 
monitor your heart, because the 
risk of cardiac arrest is elevated 
for a week or two. 

Oh my God.

ELISE

STAN

(Pats her hand)

OK...OK...

DR BETHENY

But in between these episodes, most 
people feel perfectly healthy and 
you can basically live a normal 
life. 

JOE

So...What do you mean that some 
people live as long as fifty or 
sixty years? You mean total? Or 
from when they're diagnosed with 
this, or what? And tell me the 
fuckin’ truth.

Total.

DR BETHENY

Everyone is stunned into silence, even Elise.

DR BETHENY (CONT’D)

For approximately eighty percent of 
patients your age the most common 
statistical life expectancy is five 
years or less. 

Elise grips Stan’s hand. Lee looks at the floor. 

17.

Wow. 

JOE

DR BETHENY

But the statistics vary widely, and 
they’re just statistics. You’re not 
a statistic, you’re just one 
person, and we don't know what’s 
going to happen to you yet. But 
it’s not a good disease.

What’s a good disease?

JOE

Poison Ivy. 

DR BETHENY

ELISE

(Rising)

I do not see where the humor lies 
in this situation.

Elise, you must calm down.

STAN

JOE
Honey, please...

DR BETHENY

I’m sorry. I’m really not 
trying to --

LEE

(To Dr Betheny)
Don’t -- it’s fine.

Elise pulls her hand away from Stan and waves “No” at them.

No. No more -- I’m not gonna -- 

ELISE

STAN

Elise, let’s get you a glass 
of water --

ELISE (CONT'D)

No m -- No.

Daddy. Forget it.

LEE

Hey, shut up. 

JOE (TO LEE)

ELISE

Yeah, forget it. Forget it like you 
-- No, you know what? I’m tired of 
bein’ the bad guy here. 

JOE

Jesus Christ! Who’s in the 
fuckin’ hospital?!

Nobody th --

STAN

18.

ELISE

Right! So I’ll be the bad guy, and 
you be in the hospital and explain 
the jokes to your son. I’m goin’ 
home. 
JOE

STAN 

You’re goin’ home.
SHE WALKS OUT fast, her heels clicking against the floor.

Sweetheart --

Lemme get her back.

STAN (CONT’D)

Fuck her.

LEE

JOE

You wanna stop with that 
shit?

STAN

Come on with that stuff 
already!

THE PRESENT --

INT. HOSPITAL ELEVATOR/LOWER LEVEL HALLWAY. 
The ELEVATOR DOOR OPENS AT LL2. Dr Muller and Lee come out.

INT. MORGUE.
A SECURITY GUARD opens the door for DR MULLER and LEE. 

Thank you, Tony.

DR MULLER

Lee goes in and looks down at the body. Pause. 

LEE

(Hesitates)

OK.

Take your time.

DR MULLER

Lee moves closer to the body. He touches Joe’s hand. It feels 
dead so he touches his shoulder where there’s a sleeve. He 
leans over and kisses his cheek. He embraces the body as best 
he can. Dr Muller drops back discreetly. Lee walks out past 
Dr Muller. Dr Muller follows.

DR MULLER (CONT’D)

(To the Security Guard)

Thanks, Tony.

19.

INT. ELEVATOR. 
Lee and Dr Muller ride up again in silence. 

INT. BEVERLY HOSPITAL. ICU. FLOOR. DAY -- CONTINUOUS.
The ELEVATOR DOOR OPENS. Lee and Dr Muller come out and walk 
to the Nurse’s Station, where IRENE and GEORGE wait.

LEE

I gotta get up to Manchester. 
Nobody told Patrick, right?

DR MULLER

No -- you had asked us to wait for 
you to get here --

LEE
(On “us”)

Yes -- Thank you. So...What is the 
procedure now?

DR MULLER

Well -- You should make 
arrangements with a funeral parlor, 
and they pretty much take care of 
everything. 

I don't know the name of one.

LEE

We can help you with that.

DR MULLER

Yeah.

NURSE IRENE

And they come up and get him?

LEE

Yes.

Yes.

DR MULLER

NURSE IRENE

I’ll make those calls, Lee -- 

GEORGE

GEORGE (CONT’D)

Lemme know if you need any 
help with anything.

LEE

OK. And -- OK. Thanks. And -- 
Yeah. Plus I gotta call you 
about the boat, and the web 
site. All that shit.

20.

GEORGE
Sure. I’m around.

LEE

OK. I better get up there before 
school lets out.

DR MULLER

You just have to sign for Joe’s 
belongings.

Nurse Irene takes Lee around to the nurse’s station so Lee 
can sign for Joe’s belongings.

SEVEN YEARS AGO --

EXT. THE SEA -- JOE’S BOAT. DAY.

Autumn. LEE, JOE and 8-YEAR-OLD PATRICK are on JOE’S BOAT. 
The Cape Ann coast is in the distance. The boat is rigged for 
whale-watching and deep sea fishing charters. Lee discreetly 
keeps a hand near the rod as 8-Year-Old Patrick trolls. Joe 
is at the tiller. He's looking thinner but better.

8-YEAR-OLD PATRICK

Like that?

LEE

Yeah, only keep your thumb off the 
line, ‘cause if you get a strike 
it's gonna slice it right open. And 
you know what happens then.

8-YEAR-OLD PATRICK

What?

LEE

The sharks are gonna smell that 
blood and rip this boat apart.

8-YEAR-OLD PATRICK

No they won’t. Dad, will they?

JOE

Oh yeah. I seen a school of sharks 
tear a boat to pieces like it was 
made of cardboard, just ‘cause some 
kid threw a band-aid in the water.

8-YEAR-OLD PATRICK

No you didn’t. 

21.

LEE

Sometimes the only way to keep ‘em 
off is to throw the kid directly in 
the ocean to distract ‘em.

8-YEAR-OLD PATRICK

Shut up. Sharks don’t even swim in 
schools.

JOE

Is this kid smart or what?

LEE

Yep. And a really smart kid is 
exactly the kind of quality meal a 
humongous school of sharks is 
lookin’ for when they’re circlin’ a 
boat.

PATRICK

Uncle Lee! Shut up!

Patrick's REEL starts SPINNING OUT with a thrilling whine.

LEE
Strike! Strike! 
Ease up on the drag -- 
And watch that fuckin’ thumb! 

JOE

Look out, look out! 
You got a strike! 
Ease up, ease up! 

8-YEAR-OLD PATRICK

(Hits him)

No swearing!

Patrick loses his balance. Lee catches him and props him up. 

LEE

Don't hit me -- ! Catch the 
fish! We're doin’ fine. (To 
Joe) Just drive the boat. 
Patty, pull up sharp! Come 
on, buddy! There you go! (To 
JOE) Mind your business!

JOE

What are you guys doin’? Hook 
the fish! Get the hook in him 
before he -- ! I’m drivin’ 
the goddamn boat. Get that 
hook in him!

Lee helps Patrick pull the rod back sharply a few times. 

8-YEAR-OLD PATRICK

What kind of fish is it?

JOE

Gotta be a great white, Patty
-- Maybe a barracuda --

LEE

Feels like a great white
shark to me.

Shut up!

8-YEAR-OLD PATRICK

22.

Patrick is ecstatic with nerves and excitement. 

THE PRESENT --

INT./EXT. LEE’S CAR (MOVING)/RT. 128 NORTH. DAY.
Lee drives up the highway. 

EXT. THE OCEAN -- MANCHESTER-BY-THE-SEA. DAY.
FROM THE OCEAN -- We see the wealthy summer resort clinging 
to the Cape Ann winter coastline. 

INT. LEE’S CAR (MOVING) DAY.
Thru the windshield, Lee sees the MANCHESTER EXIT approach. 
He takes the exit.

INT./EXT. LEE’S CAR/MANCHESTER. DAY.
Lee drives past the old houses of the little town. 
SEVEN YEARS AGO --

INT. LEE’S MANCHESTER HOUSE. DAY.
Evening of the same day as the fishing scene. Lee comes into 
his small house and takes off his wet things. In the living 
room, his daughter SUZY, 7, is watching TV. A fire is 
crackling behind a fire screen. A radio is playing O.S.

Hello?

RANDI (O.S.)

LEE 

Hi honey! (To the girl) Hi, Suzy. 
Daddy’s home. (Pause) Hi, Suzy. 
Daddy’s home.

Hi Daddy.

SUZY

Hi, sweetheart.

LEE

He bends down to kiss her. She hooks her arm around his neck 
and pulls him off balance, her eyes locked on the TV screen.

Hug.

SUZY

LEE (CONT'D)

Jesus Christ, you’re breakin’ 
my neck.

23.

He kisses her and she releases him.

Lee?

RANDI (O.S.)

Yeah, hiya!

LEE

INT. BEDROOM. DAY.
RANDI, Lee’s wife, 30s, is in bed with a cold. She is tough, 
loving and sarcastic. The room is littered with Kleenex and 
cold remedies and clothes. KAREN, 5, is playing with colored 
plastic blocks on the floor. There is a CRIB in a corner.

Hi honey.

LEE

You have a good time?

RANDI

LEE

Yeah, really good. Where’s your 
mother?

RANDI
They just left.

Oh no.

LEE

Yeah, she really missed you.

RANDI

LEE

There’s always next time. Did you 
sleep?

RANDI

Oh, yeah. It’s always restful when 
my mother’s here.

That’s too bad. Hi Kary.

LEE

Hi Daddy.

KAREN

LEE

(Picking her up)

Hello sweetheart. 

Put me down.

KAREN

24.

I’m puttin’ you down. Relax.

LEE

He kisses her and starts to put her down. She wriggles and 
jerks unexpectedly backward. Lee almost loses his grip.

LEE (CONT’D)

Hey, hey, hey!

Karen...!

RANDI

LEE

(Putting her down)

Honey, don’t jerk around like that, 
I almost dropped you on your head.

I’m making a hair salon.

KAREN

LEE

Oh yeah? It’s really good. You 
wanna cut my hair?

It’s just for girls. I’m sorry.

KAREN

LEE

I understand. (To Randi) How you 
feelin’? 

RANDI

Little better.
LEE

You sound better.

RANDI

Did you actually use the fishin’ 
tackle? 

LEE

Yeah, we really did. Patrick got a 
humongous bluefish. Eighteen 
pounds. 

Oh yeah? That’s awesome! 

RANDI

LEE

I never seen anybody so happy in my 
life. 

He crosses to her through the tissue-strewn, cluttered room. 

LEE (CONT’D)
It’s nice in here. You keep it 
nice. What a homemaker.

25.

Fuck off. 

RANDI

He tries to kiss her. She turns her head. 

Get away from me.

RANDI (CONT’D)

They kiss. She claps his hand onto her breast.

No, don't, stop, I'm sick. 

RANDI (CONT'D)

They kiss some more. She shoves him away.

OK, get offa me.

RANDI (CONT'D)

Lee goes to the CRIB. Inside is STANLEY, 8 months old, awake 
and placid, waving his limbs at a multicolored mobile.

LEE

Hi Stanny. How come you’re not 
cryin’?

RANDI

Let him alone. He’s been quiet for 
half an hour. 

Lee picks the baby up.

LEE

Half an hour. What is that 
about? Take it easy. (To the 
baby) Hiya buddy. You are 
very handsome. 

RANDI (CONT'D)

Oh Lee, please don't pick him 
up! 

If he’s not makin’ any noise, 
leave well enough alone.

LEE

“Leave well enough alone.” That’s 
what me and Mummy shoulda done 
instead of gettin’ married. 

RANDI

(Opens her magazine)

Just shut up.
LEE

...but then you wouldn’t be here. 
And neither would your sisters. And 
I could watch the football game in 
my own livin’ room. That’s right, I 
could.

Go fuck yourself.

RANDI

26.

Lee kisses the baby and puts him back in the crib.

LEE

See? I didn’t make him cry. ‘Cause 
I know how to handle him. 

How was Joe?

RANDI

LEE

He’s all right. You know? He’s 
doin’ all right.
RANDI

And you didn’t run outta beer? You 
got through the day OK?

Oh yeah. We were very temperate.

LEE

RANDI 

I don’t know why you guys bother 
gettin’ on the friggin’ boat.

Because we love the sea.   

LEE

LEE (CONT’D)

I only had eight beers over a seven 
hour period. That’s approximately 
one point four two somethin’ beers 
per hour.

RANDI

No, it’s almost like a normal 
person stayin’ sober.

I told you I was cuttin’ down.

LEE

Lee starts to get undressed.

What do you think you’re gonna do? 

RANDI

LEE

I guess I’m gonna take a shower. 
Randi, I swear to God. You shoulda 
seen the look on Patty’s face when 
he caught that fish. It was like 
takin’ Suzy on the merry-go-round. 
It was like -- pure happiness.

She smiles at him. Lee crawls across the bed. 

27.

RANDI

Get away. I’m sick. I’m deeply 
sick.

They kiss. Karen plays on the floor. The baby waves his arms. 
The TV can be heard from the other room.

LEE (V.O.)
He’s not at school? 

THE PRESENT --

EXT./INT. MANCHESTER -- PINE STREET/LEE’S CAR. DAY.
Lee drives into town, talking on his cell phone.

LEE 

I thought school let out at 
three o'clock -- What? I'm 
sorry. My cell phone -- what?

PAUL (O.S.)
I'm pretty sure he --
I'm pretty sure he woulda -- 
That's all right. I’m pretty 
sure he woulda left for 
hockey practice by now. 

EXT. MANCHESTER ESSEX REGIONAL HIGH SCHOOL. DAY
Over an establishing shot of the big school building we hear:

He’s on the hockey team?

LEE (O.S.)

INT. VICE PRINCIPAL’S OFFICE. DAY -- CONTINUOUS.
PAUL, the vice principal, 40, is on the phone. His ASSISTANT, 
50s, is on her computer nearby. WE CUT BETWEEN PAUL AND LEE.

PAUL

Yeah, he’s doin’ real well, too.  
How’s Joe doin’? He gonna be OK?

LEE

He’s fine. Where’s the practice at? 
The school? 

No -- It’s in Gloucester.

PAUL

PAUL (CONT’D)

It’s at the Gloucester -- 
That’s OK. Can you hear me?

We play with the Rockport 
team.  But they’re the lead 
team. 

LEE

It’s not at school? What?
I’m sorry -- This phone is -- 
Yes. 

I understand -- 

28.

OK, thanks, Paul. I gotta go.

LEE (CONT’D)

PAUL

Sure thing. Give Joe my regards, 
will you?

I will. 

LEE

INT. VICE PRINCIPAL’S OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS.
PAUL hangs up. 

PAUL

Joe Chandler’s in the hospital 
again.

ASSISTANT

Oh my gosh...Oh my gosh. That poor 
man has had more trouble...

Yep.

PAUL

Who was on the phone?

ASSISTANT

That was Lee Chandler.

PAUL

Lee Chandler?

ASSISTANT

The very one.

PAUL

INT./EXT. LEE’S CAR/RT 128 NORTH. DAY.
Lee drives. The SIGN for GLOUCESTER and ROCKPORT is up ahead.

INT. GLOUCESTER MIDDLE SCHOOL -- HOCKEY RINK. DAY.
The Rockport/Manchester team is having practice. PATRICK is 
on the ice. He is just 16, skinny, athletic, long-haired. He 
is bright, practical, pugnacious. The HOCKEY COACH, 40s, is 
shouting instructions. PATRICK checks another KID against the 
boards. They start fighting. They’re evenly matched but 
Patrick is kind of wild. The COACH yanks Patrick off the 
other kid.

HOCKEY COACH

OK, break it up! Break it up! You! 
Chandler! One more time and you are 
OUT. Understand me? 

Patrick sees LEE in the stands, over the coach’s shoulder..

29.

Aw, fuck me.

PATRICK

HOCKEY COACH
What’s that, Chandler?

Aw, fuck my fuckin’ ass.

PATRICK

OK, you are out! You’re benched!

HOCKEY COACH

PATRICK

(To himself, skating away)

Ask me if I give a shit.

What’s that? What’s the matter?

HOCKEY COACH

Patrick skates over to Lee. The Coach sees Lee and hesitates. 
A small scrappy kid named JOEL skates up, followed by CJ, a 
big handsome athletic kid. These are Patrick’s friends.

That’s his uncle. 

JOEL

His dad must be in the hospital.

CJ

HOCKEY COACH
Whose dad? Chandler’s? 

CJ

JOEL

He’s got congestive heart 
failure. Patrick’s dad, I 
mean. Not Patrick.
Some other kids skate up and are watching Patrick and LEE.

...He only comes up when Mr 
Chandler’s in the hospital. 

HOCKEY COACH

That’s Lee Chandler? The Lee 
Chandler?

CJ

Yeah, but you know that stuff about 
him’s bullshit, Mr Howard.

Yeah, that story’s bullshit.

JOEL

You guys wanna watch the language?

HOCKEY COACH

30.

JOEL

CJ

Sorry.
Across the rink, Lee is talking to Patrick. Patrick is 
kicking up little shards of ice with his skate. The Coach 
notices that all the kids have stopped to watch.

Sorry.

HOCKEY COACH

OK, Everybody wanna mind their own 
business? Five minute break. That 
means five! 

The kids break up, marginally. The Coach skates over to Lee 
and Patrick. They talk briefly. The Coach puts a well-meant 
but sentimental hand on Patrick’s shoulder. Lee goes back up 
the aisle. 
CJ and Joel skate over to Patrick. He tells them. They react 
sincerely and with sympathy. They squeeze his shoulder, they 
each hug him. All the kids are watching again by now. 

HOCKEY COACH (CONT’D)

OK, show’s over! Let’s line it up 
again! Come on, line up!

The kids start skating around, lining up at the blue line. 
Patrick breaks away and skates toward the exit by himself.

INT. LEE’S CAR (MOVING). DUSK.
The winter sun is getting low. Patrick sports a semi-grunge 
garage-band look. Longish greasy hair, Army jacket, black T-
shirt with some design on it, cargo pants maybe.

Oh well.

PATRICK

They pass a sign for MANCHESTER, BEVERLY and NORTH SALEM.

LEE

I gotta go back to the hospital and 
sign some papers. Do you wanna see 
him? 

PATRICK
Him who? See who?

Your dad. Do you wanna look at him?

LEE

PATRICK

I don’t know. What does he look 
like?

31.

LEE

He looks like he's dead. (Pause) I 
mean, he doesn't look like he's 
asleep, or anything like that. He 
doesn't look gross...(Pause) You 
don't have to. I wanted to see him. 
Maybe you don't want that image in 
your memory. I don't know. It's up 
to you.

Patrick is silent.

INT/EXT. LEE’S CAR/HOSPITAL PARKING LOT. DUSK.
Lee pulls into a parking space. He looks at Patrick, who is 
looking slightly queasy.
LEE

What do you think? Should I take 
you home? Do you want me to decide?

Let's just go.

PATRICK

At the same instant Patrick opens his door to step out and 
Lee starts DRIVING. He slams on the brakes.

What the fuck are you doing?

LEE

I just said let’s go inside!

PATRICK

No, you just said “Let’s just go!” 

LEE

LEE (CONT’D)

And then you get out of the 
car without telling me? 
What the fuck’s the matter 
with you?

I coulda ripped your fuckin’ 
leg off, that’s my problem.

PATRICK

Yeah, I meant let’s go 
inside. I meant let’s just go 
look at him! 

OK, OK! What’s your problem?

OK! I’m sorry I misused the 
English language!

They get out of the car, both more subdued.

I’m sorry, Uncle Lee.

PATRICK (CONT’D)

I’m sorry too. I just got scared. 

LEE

INT. HOSPITAL MORGUE. 
NURSE IRENE and LEE stand by while Patrick looks at Joe.

32.

OK. Thank you.

PATRICK

Of course...

NURSE IRENE

Patrick walks away. Lee and Dr Muller follow.

INT/EXT. LEE’S CAR (MOVING)/R 128 NORTH. DUSK/NIGHT.
They drive in silence.

Well, that was a mistake.

PATRICK

I guess I gave you bad advice.

LEE

PATRICK
No...I decided...

EXT. THE SEA. DUSK/NIGHT.
WIDE ON THE COAST: A few headlights move through in the dark 
town.

EXT. MANCHESTER -- STREETS. NIGHT.
Lee’s car drives through the narrow hilly streets.

INT. LEE’S CAR. (MOVING) DUSK/NIGHT. SIMULTANEOUS.
They drive in silence. Lee slows the car to a halt. The 
narrow street is blocked by an SUV by a big house. A visiting 
family is saying goodnight to a family in front of the house.

Come on...(Pause) Come on, come on!

LEE

He HONKS the HORN LOUD, TWICE. Everybody looks at him. The 
CAR DAD comes around to the driver’s side of the SUV... 

Sorry! Sorry! Come on, guys...!

CAR DAD

The others continue saying goodbye and chatting. Lee HONKS 
the HORN several times.

33.

LEE

PATRICK

Either get in the car or move 
it in the driveway!
The Car Dad turns around. The House Dad takes a step forward. 

What’s the matter with you?

CAR DAD

What’s your problem, pal?

LEE

Don’t tell me to relax. 
You're sitting in the middle 
of the street. (HONKS)

          PATRICK
Would you stop it, Uncle Lee? 
It's the Galvins and the 
Doherties! Jesus!

           LEE 
Oh. It is?

           PATRICK
Yes! What’s the matter with 
you?

           LEE 
I’m sorry.

           PATRICK
(Waving out the window) Hiya 
Mr Doherty. It’s Patrick 
Chandler. Hi Mrs Doherty...Mr 
Doherty! It’s OK: It’s 
Patrick Chandler!

Yeah, it’s just me. Hi. Sorry 
about that. We’re just late. 
How are you?

           PATRICK
Hi Mrs. Galvin. Hiya Mrs. 
Doherty.

I’m OK. How are you? Sorry 
about that.

CAR MOM

We're leavin’, we’re leavin’! 
Sorry! (Kisses House Mom) 
I’ll call you tomorrow. (To 
LEE) OK, OK, OK! In the car, 
kids!

           CAR DAD
You wanna play tough guy with 
me in front of all my kids?

           HOUSE MOM
Goodnight kids! Come over any 
time!

            CAR KIDS 
Goodbye! Thank you!

            CAR MOM 
Tommy, come on.

          CAR DAD 
Patrick? Is that you?

Well, for Christ’s sakes! 
Where’s the fire?

           HOUSE MOM 
Hello, Patrick.

           HOUSE DAD 
Patrick? Jesus, what’s the 
ruckus all about? How are 
you?

           CAR MOM
Oh for goodness sake...!

CAR DAD

(Squinting)

Who is that?          

34.

PATRICK 

It’s just my Uncle Lee. It’s 
my uncle. 

It’s Lee Chandler. 

LEE

Lee?

CAR DAD

There is instant awkwardness between them. 

LEE

Hi Tom. Sorry -- I’m sorry: I 
didn’t know you...

CAR DAD (CONT'D)

Oh. Hey, Lee...What’s all the 
rumpus for?

          CAR MOM
Hello, Patrick.      

Well, keep your shirt on 
on...! I’m movin’.

           PATRICK 
Hi, Mrs Galvin.
Lee calls to the House Dad through Patrick’s open window.

Hello, Jeff. Hello, Arlene.

LEE

HOUSE KIDS

Hi, Patrick! Hey, Patrick!

          PATRICK 
          HOUSE DAD (Coldly)
Hey guys. How’s it goin’? 
Hey, Lee.  
CU: HOUSE MOM. She pointedly refuses to answer Lee at all.

...Sorry about the ruckus.

LEE

Patrick, how’s your dad?

HOUSE MOM

He’s fine.

PATRICK

EXT. JOE’S HOUSE. NIGHT. 
The car stops in front of the GARAGE of a small well-kept old 
clapboard house with lots of bare trees and shrubs around. 

You gotta hit the bleeper.

PATRICK

I don’t have the bleeper.

LEE

I’ll do it. There’s a code.

PATRICK

Patrick gets out and goes to open the garage door manually.

35.

INT. JOE’S HOUSE. NIGHT.
Lee and Patrick come in and turn on the lights. The house is 
just as it was that morning. The Boston Globe sports section 
is spread on the sofa. One of Joe’s plaid shirts is draped 
over the back of the chair.
PATRICK

Is it OK if some of my friends come 
over? I told ‘em I would call ‘em.

Go ahead. 

LEE

PATRICK

Can we get some pizza? There’s 
nothing to eat here.

LEE

Yeah. Sure. (Takes out his iPhone) 
What kind do you want?

Any kind is fine. Thank you.

PATRICK

Lee takes out his phone. Patrick starts to text his friends.

INT. JOE’S HOUSE -- LIVING ROOM. NIGHT.
Patrick, Joel and CJ and SILVIE, who seems to be Patrick’s 
girlfriend, are all sitting around in the living room. They 
are a bit awkward but well-meaning -- except Silvie, who is 
over-relaxed and too touchy-feely with Patrick.

SILVIE

At least he didn’t suffer. It’s 
worse for the family, but it’s 
better for the person.

CJ

Well, he was a fuckin’ great guy, 
Patrick, I’ll tell you that. 

That’s for sure.

JOEL

CJ

I remember one time he took us all 
out in the boat? Like in sixth 
grade? 

JOEL
I remember that.

I remember. And he says --

The boys laugh.

36.

CJ (CONT'D)

And he made us wear life 
preservers? And I was like, 
“What’s the difference, Mr 
Chandler? Boat sinks in this 
weather we’re dead anyway.” 
And he says “The life 
jacket’s to make it easier on 
the sharks when you go over.”

PATRICK

Yeah, he really liked those shark 
jokes.

He was funny, boy. 

JOEL

SILVIE

Yeah, but he was gentle too, you 
know? (Strokes Patrick’s hair) Like 
his son.

This piece of sentimentality embarrasses everyone but Silvie.

INT. JOE’S KITCHEN. SIMULTANEOUS.
Lee is at the table, halfway through a piece of pizza and a 
beer. He finishes the beer, gets another and heads into --

INT. JOE’S LIVING ROOM. CONTINUOUS.
Lee moves through the room toward the staircase.
JOEL
Star Trek sucks.

CJ

And there’s this former 
starship captain -- this 
former starship captain, shut 
up --

How you doin’, baby?

SILVIE

          PATRICK
OK.

Star Trek sucks my ass.

CJ

Star Trek is one of the 
pillars of modern 
entertainment. 

          JOEL
One of the pillars of modern 
entertainment is retarded.

CJ (CONT'D)

No it’s not! Ask Patrick! Ask 
him! Moron!

JOEL

Read my lips. Star Trek is 
retarded. It’s retarded. 

37.

SILVIE

I can’t believe we’re talking about
Star Trek right now!!

This effectively kills the conversation. She goes back to 
stroking his hair. LEE keeps going up the stairs.

I like Star Trek...

PATRICK

INT. JOE’S ROOM. NIGHT.
Lee snaps on the lights and comes in. The room is tidy except 
for a few items: A coffee mug, an open book on the floor by 
the bed. Lee opens the bottom dresser drawer and takes out a 
pair of Joe’s neatly folded pajamas.

INT. GUEST/LEE’S ROOM. NIGHT.
Lee lies on top of the bed, wearing Joe’s pajamas, drinking 
beer and watching television. Patrick knocks and comes in.

PATRICK

Hey, Uncle Lee? Is it OK if Silvie 
sleeps over? Dad always let her.

Then what are you asking me for?

LEE

PATRICK

No reason. Thanks.(Pause) So -- Not 
that it would come up, but her 
parents think she stays downstairs 
when she stays over? So if it comes 
up for some reason, can you just 
say she stayed in the downstairs 
room?

I don’t even know them.

LEE

PATRICK

Yes you do. It’s the McGanns. Frank 
and Pat McGann.

That’s Silvie McGann?

LEE

PATRICK

Yeah. So do you mind sayin’ she 
stayed downstairs? Like if they 
call or something?

OK.

LEE

Patrick hesitates. 

LEE (CONT'D)

Am I supposed to tell you to use a 
condom?

38.

PATRICK

No...I mean -- Unless you really 
feel like it.
LEE

Is that what Joe would say?

PATRICK

No. I mean, yes. I mean, we’ve had
“The Discussion” and everything.

OK.

LEE

PATRICK

Just lemme know if we’re makin’ too 
much noise.

OK.

LEE

PATRICK

Hey. Do you think I should call my 
mom? To tell her about Dad?

LEE

(Tenses)

I wouldn’t, Patty. I don’t think 
anybody even knows where she is...

PATRICK

All right. I was just curious what 
you thought. Anyway...Good night, 
Uncle Lee.

Good night.

LEE

Patrick surprises Lee by going to him and giving him an 
awkward hug. Patrick heads for the door.

INT. GUEST/LEE’S ROOM. NIGHT.
Lee lies on the bed. 
SIX YEARS AGO --

39.

INT. JOE & ELISE’S HOUSE. SUMMER -- DUSK.
The room is DARK except for the TV. Two little DOGS start 
BARKING. JOE, 9-YEAR-OLD PATRICK and LEE come in the house. 
They are muddy and dusty from playing softball. They drop the 
softball gear, start taking off their muddy sneakers, etc.

JOE

-- and now you’re gonna sulk all 
night because you dropped the 
goddamn ball?

9-YEAR-OLD PATRICK

I’m not sulking.

          JOE (To Lee) 
Shut up! (To Patrick) If you 
would use a goddamn baseball 
mitt you wouldn’t drop the 
fuckin’ ball.

LEE (To JOE)

Why don’t you stop already? 
You wanna stop? 

Why don’t you kill him? 
I think you should kill him. 

          9-YEAR-OLD PATRICK
Shaddup, shaddUP, you stupid 
I don't need a baseball mitt. 
dogs! ELISE!
I catch better without one!
Joe flicks on the LIGHTS. The small living room is trashed.

Ah, shit.

JOE

Dad! No cursing!

9-YEAR-OLD PATRICK 

ELISE is PASSED OUT on the SOFA, her short nightie scrunched 
up underneath her. She's got no underwear on, so the men and 
9-Year-Old Patrick can see everything. There's a half-empty 
bottle and a glass of liquor on the coffee table. Cigarette 
butts spill over the ashtray. Joe takes immediate control.

JOE

Lee, you wanna take Patty upstairs 
and get him washed up? Go on up, 
Patty. Everything’s OK.

Come on, buddy.

LEE

POV LEE as he takes Patrick upstairs: Joe pulls down Elise’s 
nightie. Looks at his shoe. There’s a little dog shit on it.

Oh, come on.

JOE

POV LEE as Joe sees that the dogs have peed and crapped all 
over the floor -- a whole day’s worth.
THE PRESENT --

40.

INT. GUEST/LEE’S ROOM. NIGHT.
Lee is lying in bed. He switches off the light. We can hear 
the ocean outside.

INT. PATRICK’S ROOM. SIMULTANEOUS.
SILVIE is asleep on Patrick’s single bed. PATRICK is at his 
desk typing on his laptop. We see what he is TYPING:

“Dear Mom --”

EXT. JOE’S HOUSE. DAY.
A clear cold day. The house has a nice view of the town.

INT. KITCHEN. DAY.
Lee is dressed and seated at the table with a cup of coffee, 
talking on his iPhone.

LEE

(On the phone)

Beverly, Massachusetts ... 
Gallagher Funeral Home please ... 

SILVIE comes through the kitchen door, dressed, very 
comfortable in the house. 
SILVIE

Morning.

Hello.

LEE

Over the following she gets some juice and yogurt out of the 
fridge, some herbal tea, and puts on the kettle, while Lee 
watches her. Patrick enters, gets some cold cereal.
LATER -- They are all at the table. Lee is still on the 
phone.

Pass the milk please.

PATRICK

LEE 

So but, I don't know what I gotta 
do to get his body from the 
hospital to your place, but they 
said ... Oh, OK...

41.

SILVIE

Excuse me, Mr Chandler? I don’t 
think Patrick needs to be here for 
this.

PATRICK
That’s all right.

Lee gets up and goes out. Silvie puts a hand on Patrick’s 
hand. We can hear LEE’S VOICE from the other room. 

LEE (O.S.)

So why is it more to drive his body 
to Manchester? ‘Cause you gotta 
take the highway for seven minutes? 
What do you charge if the hearse 
takes 127?

Jesus. Like that’s his focus?

SILVIE

He’s alright.

PATRICK

EXT. MANCHESTER ESSEX REGIONAL HIGH SCHOOL -- HALL. DAY.
Lee’s car stops in front of the school gate. Patrick and 
Silvie climb out from the back.

PATRICK
Thanks, Uncle Lee. 
He watches them walk toward the school, joining a general 
swarm of kids funneling to the school entrance. 

Thanks a lot, Mr Chandler. 

SILVIE

INT. SCHOOL. DAY. 
Patrick walks thru the halls. Various kids greet him with 
expressions of sympathy.

KID’S VOICE

Hey, Patrick. Sorry to hear about 
your dad, man.

Oh -- Thanks, man. Thank you. 

PATRICK

He presses thru. Other kids stop him with condolences.

INT. ATHLETIC DEPARTMENT OFFICE. DAY.
HOCKEY COACH Mr. Howard is seated. Patrick stands.

42.

HOCKEY COACH

We’re gonna forget about the 
language. We’re gonna forget about 
the fists. But I want you to take a 
few days offa practice. I don’t 
want you on the ice. You got enough 
on your mind. 

PATRICK

That’s OK, Mr Howard. To tell you 
the truth, I could use the 
distraction --

HOCKEY COACH

The ice is not a distraction. When 
you’re on the ice, you gotta be 
there. Take the week and we’ll 
talk. And listen: I lost my dad 
right about your age. So I know 
what you’re goin’ through. So if 
you wanna come in and talk, or you 
just want somebody to spill your 
guts to -- or you just wanna throw 
the bull around, door’s open.

INT./EXT. LEE’S CAR/MANCHESTER ESSEX HIGH SCHOOL. DAY.
Lee picks Patrick up from school and they drive away.

INT. LEE’S CAR (MOVING) DAY.
They drive through town.

You mind if I put some music on?

PATRICK

No.

LEE

Patrick turns the radio to some pop-rock station.

PATRICK 

You like these guys? The lead 
guitar is weak but otherwise 
they’re pretty good.

They all sound the same to me.

LEE

Where we going?

PATRICK

To see the lawyer.

LEE

43.

What for? 

PATRICK

We gotta read your father’s will.

LEE

PATRICK

Can’t you just drop me at home and 
tell me what it says in it?

Well, yeah -- except we’re there.

LEE

They are approaching the Manchester’s tiny business district.

EXT. STREET -- LAWYER’S OFFICE. DAY.
They walk toward the little two story office building. 

PATRICK

Who do you think he left the boat 
to?

I’m sure he left you everything.

LEE

As they go up the OUTDOOR STAIRWAY to the 2nd story office, 
We hear the SOUND of a PING-PONG game: Ka-POP, ka-POP, plus 
other growing sounds of voices and music. They take us to --
FIVE YEARS AGO --

INT. LEE & RANDI’S HOUSE -- BASEMENT DEN. NIGHT.
LEE is playing PING-PONG with TOM DOHERTY -- the CAR DAD. A 
bunch of his friends are drinking and making noise. Loud 
music. We spot JOE and GEORGE. Lee SLAMS the BALL. 

Eat my fuckin’ forehand, Tommy! 

LEE

TOM

Once! That was once! He punts 
the ball sixteen times and 
now he’s Superman.

LEE (CONT'D)

I got it workin’ now. Just 
keep away from this quadrant 
and you won’t go home in 
tears. 

RANDI appears at the top of the basement stairs in a 
bathrobe. Everybody looks up at her, like little boys.

RANDI

Would you keep it down, you fuckin’ 
morons? My kids are sleepin’.

44.

LEE 

I’m sorry, honey. (To the guys) I 
told you guys to keep it down.

RANDI

Lee, you wanna get these 
fuckin’ pinheads outta my 
house please?
Randi leaves.

THE GUYS

Yeah, Sorry, Ran/ I told you 
guys to keep it down.

She can’t talk that way to us.

LEE

Yeah. We’re not pinheads.

TOM

EVERYBODY LAUGHS. Randi immediately appears again, furious.

RANDI

Hey! I’m not fuckin’ around! It’s 
two o’clock in the fuckin’ mornin’! 
Get these fuckin’ assholes dressed 
and get ‘em the fuck outta here.

THE PRESENT --

INT. LAWYER’S OFFICE -- WAITING ROOM. DAY.
Patrick sits, texting. An ASSISTANT types at her computer.

INT. LAWYER’S OFFICE. DAY -- SIMULTANEOUSLY.
WES, 40s, sits behind his desk across from LEE. Each holds a 
copy of Joe’s will. 

I don’t understand.

LEE

WES

What -- part are you having trouble 
with...? 

I can’t be Patrick’s guardian.

LEE (On “trouble”)

WES

I understand it’s a serious 
responsibility --

No -- I mean -- I mean, I can’t --

LEE

45.

WES

Well -- Naturally I assumed that 
Joe had discussed this with you --

No. He didn’t. No.

LEE

WES

Well...I must say I’m somewhat 
taken aback -- 

He can’t live with me:

LEE

LEE (CONT’D)

I live in one room.

WES

But if you look -- Now, well, 
if you look, you’ll see Joe 
provided for Patrick’s 
upkeep: Clothes, food, et 
cetera...The house and boat 
are owned outright...

LEE

I don’t see how I could be his 
guardian.

WES

Well, those were your brother’s 
wishes.

LEE

Yeah but I can’t commute from 
Boston every day until he turns 
eighteen. 

WES

I think the idea was that you would 
relocate.

Relocate? Where? Here?

LEE

WES (CONT'D)

If you look at -- 

WES (CONT’D)

Well, yes. As you can see, your 
brother worked everything out 
extremely carefully. 

LEE

But -- He can’t have meant 
that.

46.

WES (CONT'D)

And if you -- Well, you can 
see he’s allowed up to five 
thousand dollars to help you 
with the move. There's a 
small amount set aside for  
you to draw from, as personal 
income while you settle in -- 
assuming of course that you 
accept...

What about Uncle Donny and Teresa?

LEE

WES

Well, they did come up. But Joe 
didn’t feel that Patrick really had 
any special relationship or feeling 
about them --

I don't understand.

LEE

Minnesota.
Minnetonka, Minnesota.

WES (CONT'D)

And now, I think you know 
they've moved out to 
Wisconsin, I believe..
Minnesota, that's right. 
So...

Wes watches as Lee flips through the 3-page will as if 
there's something he may have missed. After a moment:

WES (CONT'D)

It was my impression you’ve spent a 
lot of time here over the years...

LEE

Just as backup. I came up to stay 
with Patty whenever Joe was in the 
hospital, after my dad couldn’t do 
it. We -- It was supposed to be my 
Uncle Donny. I was just the backup. 

WES

Well...I can only repeat, I’m 
astonished that Joe never ran all 
this by you, thorough as he was.

LEE

Yeah, because he knew what I would 
say if he would have asked. 

FIVE YEARS AGO (CONT’D)--

Lee stands outside waving and shouting goodbyes to the CARS 
DRIVING AWAY. His friends respond with car horns and 
apologies. Randi stands inside, wrapped in a bathrobe.

47.

THE GUYS

Good night, Lee! Tell Randi 
we’re sorry! We’re so sorry! 
Good night, etc.

LEE (CONT’D)

See Jupiter? Good night! Keep 
your eyes on the road! You 
see Jupiter? Keep your eyes 
on the road! Good night 
Tommy! Good night Joe! Sorry 
again! (To the Guys) See the 
North Star? There's the North 
Star, right there!

TOM (O.C)

Where?

LEE

It’s due north...!

A MOMENT LATER -- Lee shuts the front door, shivering in his 
shirt sleeves. He tries to kiss Randi. She turns her head.

LEE (CONT’D)

I’ll clean up in the morning, baby.

RANDI 

You see Jupiter you fucking 
asshole?

He laughs.

LEE

Come on...

She lets him kiss her, then she goes off toward their 
bedroom. Lee shivers and rubs his arms.

INT. LAWYER’S OFFICE. DAY -- SIMULTANEOUS.
Lee is still staring at the will.

Lee...

WES

FIVE YEARS AGO (CONT’D) --

EXT. MANCHESTER STREET -- MINI-MART. NIGHT.
Cheerfully drunk, LEE walks along the crunchy snow-covered 
sidewalk and into a mini-mart. It’s a very cold clear night. 
THE PRESENT --

48.

INT. LAWYER’S WAITING ROOM. DAY.
Patrick is still texting away in the armchair. 

WES’S ASSISTANT

Patrick? Can I get you a soda or 
anything?

No thank you.

PATRICK

FIVE YEARS AGO (CONT’D) --

EXT. MINI-MART. NIGHT.
THROUGH THE WINDOW we see the clerk bag two six-packs, milk, 
and some Pampers for LEE. Lee comes out of the store. He has 
some drunken trouble zipping his parka as he heads home. He 
doesn’t notice the orange-red GLOW in the sky ahead. 
THE PRESENT --

INT. LAWYER’S OFFICE. DAY.

WES

Lee...Nobody can appreciate what 
you’ve been through...If I can say 
that. And if you really don’t feel 
you can take this on, that’s your 
right, obviously --

But who would get him?

LEE

WES

The probate court would appoint a 
guardian in your place.

Like who?

LEE

LEE (CONT’D)

My Uncle Donny?

WES

I don’t know -- No -- Not 
necessarily. Especially, now 
with the distance.

Who else would there be?

LEE

WES

Well...I don’t know what’s 
happening with Patrick’s mother --

No. No. 

LEE

49.

WES (CONT'D)

I’m not sure where she is, or 
what her condition is -- But 
you can bet the judge would 
certainly look into it. 

...No...Can’t do that.

LEE

FIVE YEARS AGO (CONT’D) --

EXT. LEE’S STREET. NIGHT.
Lee slows as he nears the turn to his street. He is looking 
at the FIERY SKY and FLASHING LIGHTS. He starts to run --
THE PRESENT --

INT. LAWYER’S OFFICE. DAY.
Lee sits staring out Wes’ window at the harbor.

There is Patrick to be considered.

WES

FIVE YEARS AGO (CONT’D) --

EXT. LEE & RANDI’S HOUSE. NIGHT.
The little HOUSE is COMPLETELY ON FIRE. Fire trucks and 
FIREMEN are pumping water into the blinding SMOKE. There is 
also an ambulance and police cars. TWO POLICEMEN are trying 
to control RANDI. She’s in a nightgown smeared with smoke and 
water. She thrashes violently to shake them off so she can 
run into the flaming house. She is completely hysterical.

RANDI

Let me go! Get your hands off me! 
Let go of me! Somebody go in there! 
Let me go! Get them outta there!

We PAN the faces of a clutch of neighbors looking on, 
mortified, until we land on LEE staring at the blazing house. 
He still holds the paper bag from the mini-mart.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. LEE’S HOUSE. DAWN.
The sky is getting light. The fire is out. The smoking house 
is burnt to nothing. The neighbors have been pushed back by 
the police and firemen. 

50.

Two EMS workers are putting Randi into the ambulance. She's 
on a stretcher and wears an oxygen mask. She is half 
conscious.
TWO POLICEMEN are questioning LEE. He’s still holding the 
grocery bag. JOE is standing next to him now hastily stuffed 
into his winter coat. He grips Lee’s arm with a gloved hand.
The ambulance with Randi in it drives away. LEE looks past 
the policemen as EMS WORKERS approach the next ambulance. 
They are bringing and loading THREE COVERED STRETCHERS 
bearing THREE LITTLE BODIES into the ambulance as Lee 
watches. In the last stretcher the smoke-blackened ELBOW of a 
LITTLE GIRL sticks out a little from under the blanket. An 
EMS Worker quickly pushes it under again.
They put the stretchers in the ambulance and shut the doors. 
Without moving Lee starts crying hopelessly. The two cops 
stop trying to talk to him. Joe holds Lee’s arm throughout.
THE PRESENT --

INT. LAWYER’S OFFICE. DAY.
Lee looks from the will to the view out the window.

WES

LEE

Look -- Lee --

Thanks, Wes. I’ll, uh, I’ll 
be in touch.
Lee gets up abruptly and heads for the door.
FIVE YEARS AGO (CONT’D) --

EXT. MACHESTER POLICE STATION. DAY.
PUSH IN ON a weatherbeaten old building backed by the marina.

INT. MANCHESTER POLICE STATION -- MAIN OFFICE. DAY.
JOE and STAN wait for Lee at one end of the office with a few 
desks and six or seven police officers going about their 
business. 

INT. POLICE STATION -- INTERVIEW ROOM. DAY.
SLOW PUSH IN ON LEE at a table, facing a POLICE DETECTIVE, a 
UNIFORMED POLICEMAN, and the STATE FIRE MARSHALL. 

You know. We were partyin’ pretty 
hard. 

LEE

(MORE)

51.

LEE (CONT'D)

Beer, and somebody was passin’ 
around a joint. Somebody else had 
some cocaine.

Cocaine?

Yes.

1ST DETECTIVE

LEE

1ST DETECTIVE

OK. Go on.

LEE

Anyway, our bedroom’s in the 
downstairs. The girls sleep 
upstairs. So Randi makes everybody 
leave around two o’clock, maybe 
three AM, and she went back to bed. 
So everybody leaves, and I go 
inside. And it’s really cold 
inside, so I go check on the girls,
and it’s fuckin’ freezing up there. 
We sleep downstairs. The girls
sleep in the upstairs. But Randi 
doesn’t like the central heat 
because it dries her out her 
sinuses, and she gets these 
headaches. So I went downstairs and 
built a fire in the fireplace, and 
I sit down to watch TV, except 
there’s no more beer. And I’m still 
jumpin’ like a jackrabbit. So I put 
a couple big logs on the fire so 
the house would warm up when I was 
gone, and I went to the mini-
mart...It’s about a fifteen minute 
walk both ways. But I didn’t wanna 
drive cause I was really wasted. 
And I’m halfway there, and I 
remember I didn’t put the screen 
back on the fireplace. But I figure 
it’s probably OK. So I kept going 
to the store. And that’s it. One of 
the logs musta rolled out on the 
floor when I was gone. The girls 
were all upstairs... And that’s it. 
The firemen got Randi out. She was 
passed out downstairs. And then 
they said the furnace blew, and 
they couldn’t go inside again. And 
that’s all I remember.

Pause.

52.

1ST DETECTIVE

OK, Lee. That’s all for now. We’ll 
call you if anything else comes up 
we want to ask you about.

FIRE MARSHALL

Assumin’ the forensics bear you 
out...which I’m assumin’ that they 
will...

What do you mean? That’s it?

LEE

FIRE MARSHALL

Look, Lee: You made a horrible 
mistake. Like a million other 
people did last night. But we don’t 
wanna crucify you. It’s not a crime 
to leave the screen off the 
fireplace. 

So...What? I can go?

LEE

FIRE MARSHALL

Unless somethin’ else comes up that 
we don’t know about already, yeah.

You got a ride back home?

1ST DETECTIVE

Yeah.

LEE

90

INT. POLICE STATION -- MAIN ROOM. DAY -- CONTINUOUS.
90
Lee comes out of a room opposite, followed by the Detective 
and Fire Marshall. He makes his way past the desks. Suddenly 
he GRABS a YOUNG COP from behind, pulls the GUN out of his 
holster and shoves him away. SHOUTS and GUNS come out 
everywhere. LEE puts the GUN to his own HEAD and pulls the 
trigger, but the SAFETY CATCH is ON. JOE is across the room 
in a bound.

Don’t shoot! Don’t shoot!

JOE

LEE fumbles with the safety catch -- TWO COPS take him DOWN 
and grab the gun. He doesn't resist at all. JOE joins the 
fray. STAN staggers and reaches for the wall behind him.
THE PRESENT --

INT. LAWYER’S WAITING ROOM. DAY.
LEE comes out of the lawyer’s office. Patrick gets up.

53.

LEE

Alright. Let’s go.
PATRICK

Where to, the orphanage?

Shut up.

LEE

What the hell did I do?

PATRICK

LEE
Just be quiet.

Lee heads for the exit. Patrick follows him out.

EXT. OFFICE BUILDING. DAY.
Lee and Patrick come out of the building, Lee first. They 
walk to the car. He digs out his keys.

All right. We got a lot to do.

LEE

What about the boat?

PATRICK

LEE

We gotta talk to George about it. 
There’s no point hangin’ onto it if 
no one’s gonna use it --

PATRICK
I’m gonna use it.

LEE

It’s gotta be maintained --
PATRICK

LEE (CONT'D)

...we gotta change the rental 
of the boat yard from Joe to 
me -- No, you can’t maintain 
it by yourself --

I’m maintaining it. 
I’m gonna maintain it.

Why not? 

PATRICK

PATRICK (CONT’D)

It’s my boat now, isn’t it?

What does “trustee” mean?

Does that mean you’re allowed 
to sell it if I don’t want 
you to? 

54.

LEE

Because you’re a minor. You 
can’t take it out alone. Yeah 
-- But I’m the trustee. I 
gotta make the payments, keep 
up with the inspections -- 

It means I’m in charge of 
handling everything for you 
until you turn eighteen -- 

I don’t know. But I’d 
definitely consider it --

No fuckin’ way! 

PATRICK

LEE

Don’t be so goddamn sure of 
yourself! There’s nobody to run it! 
You’re sixteen years old!

PATRICK

Yeah! I can get my licence this 
year! 

LEE

So what? You’re still a minor! You  
can’t run a commercial vessel by 
yourself!
PATRICK

Why can’t I run the boat with 
George? 

LEE (CONT'D)

Meanwhile it’s a big fuckin’ 
expense and I’m the one 
that’s gonna have to manage 
it and I’m not even gonna be 
here!

Who gives a fuck where you are?

PATRICK

LEE

Patty, I swear to God I'm gonna 
knock your fuckin’ block off!

A BUSINESSMAN in a winter coat calls from across the street.

Great parenting.

MANCHESTER BUSINESSMAN

Mind your own fuckin’ business!

LEE

Uncle Lee!

PATRICK

55.

LEE

Mind your own business! Shut 
the fuck up or I’ll fuckin’ 
shut you up, I swear to God --

I'm gonnna smash you in the 
fuckin’ face if you don't 
take a walk! Mind your 
fuckin’ business!

MANCHESTER BUSINESMAN

No no, that’s good parenting. 

Smash him in the face. Smash 
him in the face. That’ll show 
him.         
 
    PATRICK
It's OK, Mister. Thank you! 
It's OK! Uncle LEE! Are you 
fundamentally unsound?

Get in the fuckin’ car!

LEE

Lee fumbles the keys and they fly out of his hands.

PATRICK

I can’t obey your orders until you 
unlock the door.

LEE
Just shut up.

EXT. MANCHESTER -- MARINA. DAY -- PRESENT.
Lee and Patrick walk along the marina.

EXT/INT. MARINA -- JOE’S BOAT. DAY.
Lee and Patrick and GEORGE are looking at JOE’S BOAT. Lee and 
Patrick are not dressed warmly enough.

GEORGE

It’s not like the motor’s gonna die 
tomorrow, but Joe said it’s been 
breakin’ down like a son of a bitch.
PATRICK

LEE

Yeah, but we were gonna take 
a look this weekend --

See -- There’s an allotment 
of some kind -- but things 
are up in the air a little 
bit, so -- 

GEORGE

No, I can take care of it as far as 
general maintenance is concerned... 
PATRICK

I’m takin’ care of it. 

GEORGE (CONT'D)

But that motor’s gonna go at 
some point...

56.

LEE

There’s no allotment for a new 
motor. Unless you wanna buy it, 
George...

Wait a second. I’m not sellin’ it --

PATRICK

Anyway, we’re gonna be in Boston. 

LEE

PATRICK

What? Since when am I supposed to 
be in Boston?

Pause.

Well -- Whatever you decide...

GEORGE

GEORGE (CONT’D)

But it's gonna bleed you dry 
just sittin’ here...

LEE

It’s not all worked out yet. 
(To Patrick) Just take it 
easy! We don’t know what 
we’re doin’ yet.

GEORGE

Well...you know he can always stay 
with us, if he wants to come up 
weekends. 

You wanna be his guardian?

LEE

George is taken aback, embarrassed.

PATRICK

He doesn’t wanna be my 
guardian, for Christ’s 
sakes...! They got five kids 
already. Have you seen his 
house?

LEE

No -- we're just working out 
logistics...So, I didn't 
know.

           PATRICK
Jesus Christ, you wanna stop? 
George. George. It’s OK. 
Really. You don’t have to say 
that. I know that.

GEORGE

Well -- we already got a 
houseful...We’re tryin’ to 
lose some kids at this 
point...

GEORGE (CONT'D)

Yeah, we're jammed in there 
pretty good. But we've always 
got a sofa for him any time 
he wants. He knows that. (To 
Patrick) Right? 

He’s welcome any time...

EXT. MARINA/WHARF. DAY.
Lee and Patrick walk back along the wharf toward the street 
and the car.

57.

PATRICK

Are you brain-damaged? You can't 
just ask people that...! You don't 
wanna be my guardian, that's fine 
with me.

LEE

It's not that. It's just the 
logistics. I just gotta work it 
out. I swear.

PATRICK

How? By sendin’ me to Wonkatonka
Minnesota with Uncle Donny?

LEE

Minnetonka!
PATRICK

OK, Minnetonka. Minnetonka
Minnesota. Same difference!
PATRICK

What about my mother?

LEE (CONT'D)

Minnetonka Minnesota. Not 
Wonkatonka Minnesota.

Lee stops walking, then starts again.

LEE

The judge wouldn't let her. Anyway, 
no one knows where she is.

PATRICK

I do. She's in Connecticut. At 
least she was last year.

Lee stops walking again. 

Since when do you know that?

LEE

PATRICK

She emailed me last year. So I 
emailed her back. You know, email?

LEE

Did your father know you were in 
touch with her?

PATRICK

Are you kiddin’? (Pause) Could we 
walk? I'm freezin’.

They start walking again.

All I can tell you is --

LEE

58.

PATRICK

I know, I know, she's a drunk, 
she's insane, she let the dogs shit 
on the floor. 
LEE

-- it’s the last thing your
dad ever woulda wanted.

PATRICK

Oh, like you suddenly care what he 
woulda wanted?
LEE

Aw, fuck everything.

INT./EXT. LEE’S CAR(MOVING) NEAR THE MARINA. DAY.
Lee and Patrick are driving away from the marina.

PATRICK

Where to now?
LEE

The funeral parlor.

Great. 

PATRICK

INT./EXT. LEE’S CAR(MOVING) MANCHESTER OUTSKIRTS. DAY
Patrick notices they are now heading out of town.

Whoa, whoa, where’re we goin’? 

PATRICK

LEE

It’s in Beverly. 
PATRICK

There’s no funeral homes in 
Manchester?

No. (Pause) The cemetery's here...

LEE

PATRICK

Well, can you let me out? I'll just 
walk home.

59.

Let’s just get this done.

LEE

PATRICK

You wanna warn me if there's any 
other Surprise Death Errands we 
gotta run? Or is this gonna be it 
for today? 

Yes. Sorry. This is it.

LEE

EXT. BEVERLY. DAY.
They drive through Beverly, a big coastal town of 40,000.

INT. GALLAGHER’S FUNERAL HOME. DUSK.
Patrick looks around while Lee talks to the Funeral Director.

EXT. GALLAGHER’S FUNERAL HOME. DUSK.
Lee and Patrick walk away. The wind is punishing.

PATRICK

What is with that guy and the big
Serious and Somber Act?

LEE
I don't know. 

PATRICK

But seriously, does he not realize 
that people know he does this every 
single day?

LEE

I don't know. Who cares? (Stops) I
think I parked the other way. 
Sorry.

They reverse direction and start walking into the wind.

Why can't we bury him?

PATRICK

LEE

It's too cold. The ground’s too 
hard. They’ll bury him in the 
spring.

PATRICK

So what do they do with him til 
then? 

60.

They put him in a freezer.

LEE

Are you serious?

PATRICK

LEE

Yeah. That's what they do with 
them. They put ‘em in a big freezer 
until the ground thaws out.

That really freaks me out.

PATRICK

LEE 

It doesn’t matter. It isn't him. 
It's just his body. Where’d I park 
the car?

PATRICK

What about one of those mini-steam 
shovels?

What?

LEE

PATRICK

I once saw one of those mini-steam 
shovels one time in a graveyard in 
New Haven. It dug a perfect little 
hole in about two seconds.

LEE

I don’t...really know how you would 
get ahold of one. Or how much it 
would cost --

Why can't we just look into it?

PATRICK

LEE

Anyway, I’m pretty sure you can’t 
use heavy equipment in the Historic 
Rosedale Cemetery.
PATRICK

Why not?

LEE

Because there’s a lot of important 
people buried there, and their 
descendants don’t want a steam 
shovel vibratin’ over their dead 
bodies. How do I know?

61.

PATRICK

Why can't we bury him someplace 
else?

LEE

That’s where he bought a plot. 
Don’t ask me why. But if you wanna 
find someplace else to bury him, 
and find out how much it costs, and 
change all the arrangements with 
the mortician and the cemetery, and 
call up Sacred Heart and talk to 
Father Martin, and change the 
arrangements for the funeral 
service, be my guest. Otherwise 
let's just leave it. OK?

They turn onto a SIDE STREET. The wind picks up brutally.

PATRICK

I just don't like him bein’ in a 
freezer.

LEE

Oh come on! Where’s the goddamn 
car?

PATRICK

I don’t know, but I wish you’d 
figure it out because I’m freezin’ 
my ass off. 

LEE

Don’t you have a normal winter 
coat? 
PATRICK

LEE (CONT'D)

Why don’t you have gloves 
with fingers on them? 

Yes.

Another gust of wind blows right through them.

Jesus Christ!

PATRICK

LEE (CONT'D)

God damn it! 

LEE (CONT’D)

Oh where the fuck did I park the 
fucking car? 

EXT./INT. BEVERLY STREET/LEE’S CAR. DUSK.
They see the car on a long sloping street and run to it. They 
get in and slam the doors. Lee turns on the engine.

God damn it’s cold!

LEE

62.

PATRICK

Why? What’s the matter with your 
winter jacket? 

LEE

Seriously, Patty --? 
It's on already!

It's all the way up! It takes 
a minute to warm up, so just 
relax, OK?

Just be quiet.

PATRICK (CONT'D)
Just turn the heat on!

Well turn it up a little!
It’s blowin’ fuckin’ freezin’ 
air on me. 

What year did you buy this 
thing? 1928? Where’s the 
horse that goes with this 
fuckin’ car? Maybe he could 
breathe on us.

Patty, I swear to God -- 

LEE

PATRICK

I know. Why don’t we just keep my 
dad in here for the next three 
months? We could save a fuckin’ 
fortune.

LEE

Would you shut up about that 
freezer please? You want me to have 
a nervous breakdown because there's 
undertakers and a funeral? 

LEE (CONT’D)

-- Who cares?
Lee holds his hand over the vent.

No...I don’t! 

PATRICK

‘K, it’s gettin’ warmer.

LEE

PATRICK

I got band practice. Can you drive 
me home so I can get my stuff and 
then take me over to my 
girlfriend’s house? 

Sure. 

LEE  

EXT. MANCHESTER. SANDY’S HOUSE. DUSK.
Lee pulls up in front of a small ranch house with a big front 
yard. Patrick twists around to gets his stuff from the back. 

63.

LEE

This is the same girl as who was 
over at the house?
PATRICK

No. That was Silvie. This is Sandy. 
But they don't know about each 
other. So please don't say anything 
in case it comes up.

LEE

I won’t. (Pause) Do you actually 
have sex with these girls?

PATRICK

We don't just play computer games. 

LEE

With both of them?

PATRICK

Well with Sandy's mom here it's 
sort of strictly just basement 
business.

LEE

What does that mean?

PATRICK

It means I'm workin' on it.

Patrick grabs his electric guitar and mini-amp from the back 
seat. Lee watches him run across the lawn to the house.

INT. JOE’S HOUSE. NIGHT.
Lee comes in and snaps on the lights.

INT. KITCHEN. NIGHT.
Lee puts a slice of cold pizza in the microwave.

INT. SANDY’S HOUSE -- BASEMENT. NIGHT.

PATRICK’S ROCK BAND is practicing in the basement. SANDY, 17, 
brighter, wilder and more original than Silvie, sings lead 
vocals. PATRICK plays rhythm guitar, CJ plays lead, JOEL 
plays bass, a kid named OTTO plays drums. The boys sing 
backup. The name on the big drum is “STENTORIAN.” They are 
playing an original composition.

64.

SANDY

(Singing)

“I gotta RUN! I gotta RUN, I, I, I, 
I, I, I, I gotta run --”

THE WHOLE BAND 

“-- I gotta run, I gotta run, I 
gotta run.”

PATRICK

Stop. Stop. Otto man, what are you 
doing?

OTTO
What did I do?

PATRICK

You're way behind, man.

OTTO

No, I'm not.

You're a little behind, Otto. 

JOEL

CJ

Otto, you’re kind of draggin’ 
it...

PATRICK 

You gotta stay with the bass.

JOEL

Come on man, just stay with me, all 
right? 

OTTO

All right, I'm sorry. 

CJ

It's all right! You're alright. 
Let’s just take it again. Otto, you 
good?

OTTO

Yeah.

They get ready to take it again. Patrick leans into his 
microphone.

PATRICK
We are Stentorian.

They start playing again.

EXT. SANDY’S HOUSE. NIGHT.
Lee’s car pulls up to the curb. Stentorian thuds through the 
frozen earth. Sandy’s mom, JILL, comes out and crosses the 
lawn. She is 40, pretty and pleasant, hair in a pony tail. 
Lee rolls down the window.

65.

JILL

Hi, are you Lee? I'm Jill. Sandy’s 
mom. I think they’re wrapping up. 
Do you wanna come inside and have a 
beer or something?

Oh, that’s all right. Thank you.

LEE

JILL

I wanted to offer my condolences 
about Joe. He was such a terrific 
guy. There's not too many like him. 
He was a wonderful father.

Thank you.

LEE

JILL

I was -- I was gonna ask Patrick if 
he wants to stay for supper, if 
that's OK with you. You wanna join 
us? I made way too much...

LEE

Oh. That’s all right. Thank you. 
What time should I come back?

JILL

Oh -- I don’t know. Nine? Nine-
thirty? They’re gonna do their 
homework together. Supposedly. Ha 
ha ha. 

OK. I’ll come back at nine-thirty.

LEE

JILL

OK. You change your mind in the 
next ten minutes, we’re right 
inside. 

OK. Thank you. 

LEE

Jill hesitates, smiles, then runs back to the house. Lee 
drives off.

66.

INT. SANDY’S ROOM. NIGHT.
Patrick and Sandy are making out on her bed. Patrick’s hand 
is halfway down the front of Sandy’s complicated jeans.

SANDY

Hold on -- Hold on.
Just take your hand out.

PATRICK

Jesus Christ, I’m scrapin’ 
the skin off my knuckles. How 
do you unbuckle this?

SANDY

Would you please take your hand 
outta my cunt?

OK, OK! (Withdraws his hand) Ow!

PATRICK

Sandy wriggles out of her jeans. 

PATRICK (CONT’D)

Oh, are we taking our pants off?

SANDY

I'm takin' my pants off. I don't 
know what you're doing.

PATRICK

I'm takin' my pants off...

Patrick tries to take off his pants, but one leg bunches up 
at his ankle. He kicks to get it off. She tries to help him. 

SANDY

Come on! You gotta take your shoe 
off...!

I’m tryin’!

PATRICK

O.C., Jill KNOCKS on the DOOR. The kids both scramble away 
from each other and frantically start to dress.

JILL (O.C.)

Hey kids? Come on have some dinner!
PATRICK

SANDY

OK, thanks Jill! We'll be 
down in just one second. 
I just gotta log off...!

Thanks, Mom! We’ll be right 
down! 

Would you shut up? She’s not 
retarded.

PATRICK

Why are you pickin’ on me?

67.

SANDY

I'm not pickin’ on you! You're 
going to get me in trouble.

INT. JILL’S HOUSE -- LIVING ROOM. NIGHT.
Jill waits near the stairs. Patrick and Sandy come down.

How’s the math homework?

JILL

PATRICK
Very frustratin’. 

Good.

JILL

Those algorithms are a bitch...

PATRICK

INT. JILL’S DINING AREA. NIGHT.
Jill, Sandy and Patrick eat spaghetti.

Mm. This is really delicious, Jill.

PATRICK

Thank you, Patrick.

JILL

Yeah, Mom, really good. 

SANDY

PATRICK

Is this a homemade carbonara sauce?

SANDY
Jesus, shut up.

JILL

Oh -- no...

PATRICK

You could’ve fooled me.

SANDY

PATRICK

Jesus.

What? 

SANDY

You're such a kiss-ass!

68.

JILL

Sandy!

PATRICK

Why? Because I appreciate your 
mother's cookin'?

INT. LEE’S CAR (MOVING) NIGHT.

Lee drives Patrick home in silence. Then:

PATRICK

Aren’t you gonna ask what 
happpened? -- Guess not.

LEE

I don’t want to know what 
happened.

INT. JOE’S LIVING ROOM. NIGHT.
Lee is on the sofa with his iPhone and a beer, watching a 
Celtics game. A PHONE RINGS. He looks around, confused. Looks 
at his cell. Finally he realizes Joe’s LAND LINE is ringing.

LEE

(Answering)

Hello?

RANDI

(Over the phone)

Hello...Lee? It’s Randi. (Pause) 
Hello? Lee?

Pause.

Yeah. I’m here. Sorry. How are you?

LEE

I’m OK. How are you?

RANDI

Good.

LEE

RANDI

I was callin’ -- George told me 
about Joe. I just wanted to call 
and say I’m sorry. I hope you don’t 
mind me callin’.

LEE

No. Thank you. I don’t mind...How 
are you?

69.

RANDI

Not so good, right now. I guess we 
shoulda seen it comin’, but...it’s 
still kinda hard to believe... 

Yeah...

LEE

RANDI

How’s Patrick doin’? Beyond the 
obvious, obviously...

LEE

He’s OK. It’s hard to tell with 
kids.

Yeah --

RANDI

Well, that’s good. 

LEE (CONT'D)

He doesn’t really open up 
with me. I think he’s OK. 
He’s got a lotta 
friends...So...Yeah, it is...

RANDI

So, I don't know if you planned a 
service yet, but I was also gonna 
ask you if you wouldn't mind -- I'd 
like to be there, if it's OK with 
you.

Of course you can... 

LEE

RANDI

OK. Thank you. It would mean 
a lot to me -- OK -- Thank 
you.

LEE (CONT'D)

That's fine. You should come. 
I'll let you know when it's 
gonna be.

RANDI

Thank you. (Pause) So, can I ask -- 
How are you? 
LEE

I don’t know. How are you?

RANDI

You know. We're doin’ pretty well. 
I should probably tell you -- I’m 
gonna be -- I’m pregnant. Actually.

Oh yeah?

LEE

Yeah. Like -- Ready to pop.

RANDI

Oh, I didn't know that. 

LEE

RANDI (CONT'D)

I didn’t know if I should 
tell you,  but --

70.

No, it’s fine. Congratulations.

LEE

RANDI

Thank you. You would probably 
deduce it for yourself when you see 
me.

Yeah.

LEE

Lee is unable to stay on the phone any longer.

So, are you still -- 

RANDI

LEE (CONT'D)

Actually, sorry -- I don’t 
mean to cut you off. I just 
gotta go pick up Patrick up 
and I’m slightly late. 

RANDI

That’s OK. I just wanted to make 
sure it’s OK if me and Josh come to 
the funeral.

LEE

It’s totally OK.
RANDI

OK. Thank you, Lee. God bless.

So long.

LEE

They hang up. Lee tries to keep a grip on himself. 

INT. PATRICK’S ROOM. NIGHT. 
Patrick lies awake in the dark.

INT. LEE’S ROOM. NIGHT.
Lee lies on the bed watching a sports show and drinking beer. 

EXT. MANCHESTER -- CHURCH OF THE SACRED HEART. DAY.
A beautiful day. A lot of people are filing into the church.

71.

INT. CHURCH. DAY.
SLO-MO (MOS). People are greeting PATRICK. LEE stands to one 
side. Some people greet him, some do not, some look at him 
covertly. 
GEORGE and his wife JANINE, 50, say hi to Lee and Patrick. 
Then a very pregnant RANDI gives Patrick a big warm hug. She 
and her husband, JOSH, greet Lee. Randi says a few words to 
Lee. Josh shakes Lee’s hand. Then they move away. 
Others come through: Grown-ups and kids. DR BETHENY and her 
HUSBAND. George stays dutifully by Lee.
LATER -- STILL SLO-MO (MOS) THE SERVICE. FATHER MARTIN reads 
the service. LEE sits in the front pew, with PATRICK, looking 
lost.

EXT. GEORGE’S HOUSE. DAY.
George’s small, cramped, two-story house. Cars are stuffed 
into George’s driveway and ranged up and down the block. 

INT. GEORGE’S HOUSE. DAY.
The living room is packed with mourners, eating and drinking. 
(Randi and Josh are not there.) PATRICK is hugging SANDY and 
JILL. They are leaving. He keeps an eye out for SILVIE, who 
is across the room talking to CJ, Joel and some other kids.
LATER -- PATRICK is in an armchair, watching LEE through the 
press of chatting mourners. Lee holds a beer and looks lost. 
TOM DOHERTY appears, shakes Lee’s hand and gives him a hug 
which Lee rigidly returns. MRS DOHERTY kisses Lee. 
SILVIE appears at Patrick’s side. She gives him some soda in 
a plastic cup. Her eyes intrusively search his face.

You OK, baby?

SILVIE

I’m OK.

PATRICK

LATER -- LEE and GEORGE are talking over the din.

So how you holdin’ up?

GEORGE

What’s the matter? 

LEE

No --

GEORGE

LEE

What? 

Um...

GEORGE (CONT'D)

-- I said “How you holdin’ 
up?” It’s a stupid question. 
You get some food?

72.

I had some cheese.

LEE

“You had some cheese.” Asshole. 

GEORGE

LEE
It’s OK, George.

GEORGE (CONT'D)

I’ll get you something. Hey 
JANINE!

We see JANINE through the crowd, replenishing items at the 
buffet table and clearing paper plates and napkins, etc. 

Seriously. I’m not hungry. 

LEE

GEORGE

Sure? (To JANINE) Never mind! 
FORGET IT! SKIP IT!
I SAID FORGET IT!

JANINE

WHAT? 
I CAN’T HEAR A GODDAMN THING 
YOU’RE SAYIN’!

DID LEE GET SOME FOOD?

JANINE (CONT’D)

INT. JOE’S HOUSE -- KITCHEN. NIGHT.
Lee comes in and takes off his dark jacket and gets some cold 
chicken from the fridge. Patrick comes in, iPhone in hand.

PATRICK

Hey, is it OK if I ask Silvie to 
stay over?

No.

LEE

PATRICK
What do you mean? 

LEE

I don’t want her in the house right 
now.

PATRICK

Why not? YOU don’t have to talk to 
her...

73.

LEE

I don’t like her. You can go to her 
house or call one of your friends. 
That’s it.

Patrick is stunned.

INT. GUEST/LEE’S ROOM. NIGHT.
Lee gets ready for bed. We hear PATRICK in the hall O.C.

PATRICK (O.C.) 
Would your mom be cool if I came 
there? ... I have no idea.
LATER -- Patrick KNOCKS and comes in.
PATRICK (CONT’D)

Well, I can’t go there either.

LEE

Sorry about that.
PATRICK

So...Are you gonna stay in here...?

Well -- Yeah. Why not?

LEE

PATRICK

I thought maybe you’d want to stay 
in Dad’s room. 

Why? You want me to?

LEE

PATRICK

No. It’s just a better room. And 
he’s not usin’ it...

LEE

I’ll stay in there. We’re not gonna 
be here that much longer anyway. 

PATRICK

I’m not movin’ to Boston, Uncle 
Lee.

LEE

I don’t wanna talk about that right 
now. OK?

PATRICK

You said he left you money so you 
could move.

LEE

Yes. But that doesn’t mean I 
can just --

PATRICK (CONT'D)

Anyway, what’s in Boston? 
You’re a janitor. 

74.

So what?

LEE

PATRICK

You could do that anywhere. There’s 
toilets and clogged-up drains all 
over town.

I don’t wanna talk about it!

LEE

You can’t maintain it --

PATRICK (CONT'D)

All my friends are here. I’m 
on the hockey team. I’m on 
the basketball team. I gotta 
maintain our boat now. I work 
on George’s boat two days a 
week. I got two girlfriends 
and I’m in a band. You’re a 
janitor in Quincy. What the 
hell do you care where you 
live?

Lee has no answer. 

INT. JOE’S BEDROOM -- NIGHT.
Lee puts the last of his stuff away. He goes to the window. 
The wind whistles outside. 

Goodbye Uncle Lee!

10-YEAR-OLD PATRICK (V.O.)

FIVE YEARS AGO --

EXT. JOE’S HOUSE. DAY.
A few weeks after the girls’ funeral. Joe waits by Lee’s car, 
which is packed with a few boxes and a borrowed suitcase. Lee 
and 10-YEAR-OLD Patrick come out, carrying cardboard boxes.
A moment later, Lee slams the trunk. Patrick is inside.

Where you gonna be tonight?

JOE

I don’t know. A motel.

LEE

What time you gonna call me?

JOE

75.

When I get to the motel.

LEE

JOE

If I don’t hear from you by nine 
o’clock I’m gonna call the cops. 
You understand?

Yes. Yes.

LEE

JOE

Patty! Come say goodbye to Uncle 
Lee!

That’s OK.

LEE

JOE

It is not OK. Patrick! Come say 
goodbye!

Comin’!

10-YEAR-OLD PATRICK (O.S.)

They wait. Joe hugs Lee. Lee hugs him back woodenly. Then 
with more feeling. Then he breaks away and gets in the car.

I’m gonna see him...

LEE

He starts the motor. Patrick comes running out of the house. 

10-YEAR-OLD PATRICK

(Exactly as before)

Goodbye Uncle Lee!

So long.

LEE

He drives off. Joe and Patrick watch him drive away.
PRESENT --

INT. KITCHEN. NIGHT.
Patrick, in his sleeping gear, opens the refrigerator, 
looking for a snack. He opens the overcrowded freezer and 
some packages of frozen chicken breasts and chopped meat 
slide out at him. He tries to catch or block them, but most 
of them get past him and hit the floor.

INT. JOE’S ROOM. NIGHT -- SIMULTANEOUS.
At the window, Lee hears the clatter from downstairs. 

76.

INT. KITCHEN. NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS.
Patrick looks down at the frozen meat and starts to breathe 
hard. He starts to put them back in but starts to feel sick. 
He leans his head against the freezer door then backs away, 
wiping his eyes.

I don’t want it. I don’t want it.

PATRICK

LEE comes in. Patrick can’t get ahold of himself. 

Patty --

LEE

PATRICK (CONT'D)

Somethin’s wrong with me. 

LEE

What do you mean? Like what?
PATRICK

LEE (CONT'D)

Are you sick?

I don’t know! I feel really 
weird! I’m havin’ like a 
panic attack or something.

LEE (CONT’D)

What do you mean?
PATRICK

Could you get that shit outta the 
freezer? I feel really weird.

LEE

Get ridda what? The chicken?  
PATRICK
Yes. I don’t know.

I don’t know! No!
Patrick runs out of the kitchen. 

LEE (CONT'D)

Should I take you to the 
hospital? Do you want me to 
call your friends? 

INT. PATRICK’S ROOM. NIGHT.
Patrick comes in and slams the door. Pause. Lee KNOCKS O.C.

LEE (O.C.)
You gonna go to bed?

Leave me alone.

PATRICK

LEE (O.C.)

I don’t think I should let you keep 
the door shut.

77.

Just go away!

PATRICK 

I will. Just open up the door.

LEE (O.C.)

Fuck you.

PATRICK 

LEE KICKS the DOOR IN. Patrick jumps up from his bed.

PATRICK (CONT’D)

Jesus! What’s your problem?

No! No! No! 

No! I’m just freakin’ out. 

Just go away!

No we don’t --!

LEE

I said open up the door. Are 
you havin’ a breakdown? 
Should I take you to the 
hospital? 

Fine, but I can’t let you 
freak out with the door shut. 
And if you’re gonna freak out 
every time you see a frozen 
chicken I think maybe we 
should take you the hospital. 
I don’t know anything about 
this.

PATRICK

-- I just don’t like him bein’ in 
the freezer!

LEE

You’ve expressed that very clearly. 
I don't like it either. But there’s 
nothin’ we can do about it.

PATRICK

Just get out!
LEE

No. 
PATRICK

I’m all right, OK? I just 
wanna be alone. 

LEE (CONT'D)

I’m not gonna bother you. 
I’m just gonna sit here. You 
can be alone as soon as you 
calm down.

Patrick turns his face toward the wall. Silence. 

PATRICK

I’m calmer now. Would you please 
get out?

No.

LEE

78.

Patrick his face turned away. Lee sits there.
FIVE YEARS AGO --

INT. QUINCY -- LEE’S BASEMENT APARTMENT. DAY.
The same basement studio we saw at the beginning, minus most 
of the furniture. LEE stands watching JOE inspect the room. 
His affect is flat, colorless. 10-YEAR-OLD PATRICK is looking 
through the window up to the street. People’s feet walk by.

Cool!

10-YEAR-OLD PATRICK

How much are they payin’ you?

JOE

Minimum wage plus the room.

LEE

Let’s go get some furniture.

JOE

I got furniture.

LEE

JOE

No you don’t. This doesn’t count as 
furniture. This is not a room. 
Let’s go get some furniture.

Get off my back.

LEE

Patty, come on. (To Lee) Let’s go.

JOE

INT. BOSTON DEPARTMENT STORE. DAY.
Joe stands with Lee looking at an armchair. Patrick is 
spinning around in another one.

You like that one?

JOE

I love it.

LEE

JOE

Good. Now you got an armchair. 
Movin’ right along. Let’s go look 
at lamps. 

Uncle Lee, try this one!

10-YEAR-OLD PATRICK

79.

JOE

Patty! Cut the crap. Let’s go get a 
lamp.

LEE
I got a lamp.
JOE

You got a light bulb. Let’s go get 
a lamp. Patty, come on.

INT. LEE’S BASEMENT APARTMENT. NIGHT.
Joe finishes tearing the paper off the armchair. The studio 
now has almost all the same furniture as in the present. LEE 
stands watching. Patrick is playing a little computer game.

Better? Better.

JOE

THE PRESENT -- 

INT. THE KITCHEN. DAY.

Lee and Patrick are at the breakfast table. Patrick is eating 
breakfast. Lee has coffee.

LEE

Listen. (Pause) We can stay until 
your school lets out. That’ll give 
me time to set things up in Boston 
better. You can do some stuff with 
George in the summer if you want 
...And you don’t get jerked out of 
your life overnight. 

Are you askin’ me or tellin’ me?

PATRICK

LEE

I’m tellin’ you it’s the best I can 
do.

PATRICK

(On “you”)

Then what the fuck do you care 
whether it’s OK with me or not?

Pause.

LEE

It’s half an hour away! You can 
come back here any time you want!

From Quincy?

PATRICK

PATRICK (CONT’D)

What is that, a joke?
It’s an hour and a half at 
least! You gotta include the 
other cars.

You couldn’t get from here to 
Quincy in half an hour if you 
flew in a fuckin’ spaceship!

80.

LEE

Yes! No! Depending on the 
traffic. Fifty minutes.

But we don’t have to stay 
there! We could look in 
Charlestown, or Everett -- 

OK, fuck it.

LEE (CONT’D)

INT. LEE’S CAR/MANCHESTER ESSEX REGIONAL HIGH SCHOOL. DAY.
Lee and Patrick pull up in front of school.

I need lunch money.

PATRICK

Lee reaches for his wallet. TWO GIRLS rap on the car window 
as they pass by on their way into the building.

Hi, Patrick! Hi, Patrick! 

1ST GIRL

Hi, Patrick!

2ND GIRL

1ST GIRL

Hey Patrick -- ! 

Patrick unrolls the window.

1ST GIRL (CONT’D)

So are you goin’ to Godspell?

PATRICK

I’m thinkin’ about it.

1ST GIRL

OK, ‘bye.

They move on, giggling. Lee reaches for his wallet.

Are they your girlfriends too?

LEE

They wish.

PATRICK

81.

LEE

Doesn’t George pay you a salary for 
helpin’ with his boat?

Yeah, but I’m savin’ that.

PATRICK

For what?

LEE

New motor.

PATRICK

Pause. He gives Patrick $20. Patrick gets out of the car.

LEE

You goin’ to Godspell?

INT. JOE’S BEDROOM. DUSK. 
Lee puts the THREE FRAMED PHOTOS on the dresser. He goes to 
the window and looks out. He BREAKS the WINDOW with his FIST. 
Blood wells out of his knuckles immediately. He hurries to 
the bathroom. The LAND LINE RINGS.

Come on...! 

LEE (O.C.)

He comes out, wrapping his hand in a towel. The blood soaks 
through quickly. He picks up the phone.

Hello?

LEE (CONT’D)

INT. ELISE’S HOUSE. DAY -- CONTINUOUS.

Elise, dressed neatly and primly, is on the phone.

ELISE

(Over the phone)
Hello, is that Lee?

WE CUT BETWEEN ELISE AND LEE.

Lee freezes. He does not respond.

ELISE (CONT’D)

(Over the phone)

Hello? Lee? It’s Elise. (Pause) 
Hello?

LEE does not respond. Blood stains the towel on his hand.

INT. JOE’S HOUSE -- DINING ROOM. NIGHT.
Lee and Patrick sit across from each other at the dinner 
table, eating. Lee has a bandage on his hand. 

82.

What happened to your hand?

PATRICK

I cut it.

LEE

PATRICK

Oh. For a minute there I didn’t 
know what happened.

INT. JOE’S ROOM. NIGHT.
Patrick comes into the room. Lee is VACUUMING up broken glass 
by the window. He has neatly taped a cardboard square over 
the broken pane. He sees Patrick and turns off the vacuum. He 
throws the last scraps of cardboard and tape into a heavy 
duty trash bag full of broken glass, cardboard, etc.

PATRICK

Is there some reason why you didn’t 
tell me my mom tried to call me? 

Lee stops in his tracks.

PATRICK (CONT’D)

She wrote me you hung up on her. 
She’s in Essex. She wants me to see 
her new house and meet her fiancee. 
(Pause) What’d you think? She 
couldn’t get in touch with me? 

LEE

I hung up because I didn’t know 
what to say to her. And I didn’t 
tell you ‘cause I didn’t know what 
to say to you. I’m sorry.

You can’t stop me talkin’ to her.

PATRICK

I don’t care what you do.

LEE

He ties off the garbage bag and goes out. Patrick follows --

INT. HALLWAY/STAIRS/LIVING ROOM/KITCHEN. CONTINUOUS.
They go down the hall, stairs, into the kitchen...

83.

PATRICK

No, but you won’t let my girlfriend 
come over and you hate my mother so 
much you won’t even tell me that 
she called. You’d rather drag me 
back to Quincy and ruin my life 
than somebody else be my guardian --

There is nobody else.

LEE

I can live in Essex with my mom. 

PATRICK

LEE
No you can’t.

PATRICK

But if she's not an alcoholic 
anymore and she wants me to stay 
with her, then I can take the bus 
to my same school and keep all my 
friends, and the boat, and you can 
go back to Boston, and you can 
still -- I don't know: Like, check 
in on me, or whatever, if you want 
to...

I can’t do that.

LEE

Why?

PATRICK

LEE

I'm sorry I hung up on her. I’ll 
call her back, and if she sounds 
semi-human to me, you can go have 
lunch with her and her fiancee if 
you want. I don’t wanna talk about 
this anymore.

Lee goes out the back door with the garbage.

EXT. MARINA/WHARF. DAY.

Lee stands by as George and Patrick pull away in JOE’S BOAT. 
Patrick is driving. 

INT. THE BOAT (MOVING). DAY.

GEORGE

OK! Soon as we get clear, open it 
up and we’ll see what we can do.

84.

OK!

PATRICK

EXT. MARINA/WHARF. DAY -- CONTINUOUS.
Lee watches them go and then turns and walks away.

INT. BOAT YARD -- FRONT OFFICE. DAY.
JERRY, 40s, is just coming into the front office as LEE comes 
thru the customer door. Jerry is immediately uncomfortable.

JERRY

Hey... Lee...! Well, what do you 
know?

How you doin’, Jerry?

LEE

JERRY

Not bad, not too bad. I was sorry 
to hear about Joe.

LEE

Yeah. Thank you.

JERRY

How’s Patrick doin’?

LEE

Good.

JERRY

Good. So what’s goin’ on?

LEE

...You know, I’m back and 
thinking about staying 
through the summer and was 
wondering if you had any 
work? If I could pick up some 
hours. 

JERRY (CONT’D)

You oughta -- Sure, sure. 
Walter is down in Boston. He 
should be back tomorrow if 
you want to come by or...Give 
him a call. 

INT. BACK OFFICE -- SIMULTANEOUS.

SUE, 50s, is at a cluttered desk doing paperwork. She hears 
voices in the front. Stops what she’s doing and listens. 

WE CUT BACK AND FORTH.

85.

LEE 

...Anyway, I’m just lookin’ 
for anything right now -- 
Fixit jobs: Boats, engines, -- 
OK: I’ll do that. No, I know. 
I just thought I’d ask.

JERRY

You oughta -- Sure, sure. You 
oughta come by tomorrow and 
talk to Walter...I doubt he’s 
got anything in February -- 
Oh, absolutely.

LEE
Thanks Jerry.

JERRY
Good to see you.

They shake hands. After Lee exits, SUE enters the FRONT 
OFFICE.

JERRY (CONT’D)

Guess who just --

SUE

I don’t wanna see him in here 
again. 

MINI-MONTAGE -- 
Lee goes into 1) COASTAL AUTOMOBILE REPAIR. 2) MILNE PLUMBING 
& HEATING. 3) HAMMC PAINTING & REMODELING. He talks to 
managers, fills out forms, walks in and out of doors... 

EXT. GEORGE’S HOUSE. NIGHT.
Lee is picking Patrick up from George’s house. GEORGE and 
JANINE and their five kids, ages 8-17, wave and shout 
goodbye.

GEORGE

So long...! Patty, I’ll see 
you Wednesday? So long, Lee!

GEORGE’S KIDS

Goodbye, Patrick! See ya, 
Patrick! Bye, Patty! G’bye!

So long...!

JANINE

PATRICK

„Bye guys! Yeah, Wednesday! 
G’bye!

INT. LEE’S CAR (MOVING). NIGHT.
Lee and Patrick get in the car and start driving.

How’s the motor?

LEE

PATRICK

George says the piston’s gonna go 
right through the block any minute 
now.

86.

LEE

Unfortunately that’s a problem. We 
can’t afford to keep the boat if we 
can’t hire somebody to work it, and 
we can’t get anyone to work it, if 
it’s got a broken motor.

Let’s take out a loan.

PATRICK

And pay it back with what?

LEE

PATRICK

We hire it out til we pay the loan 
back, obviously.

LEE

Unfortunately for you, I’m 
responsible for your finances until 
you’re twenty-one, and I’m not 
comfortable takin’ out enormous 
loans on your behalf right now.

PATRICK

I have band practice. Can you drive 
me home to get my stuff and then 
drive me to Sandy’s house?

LEE 

Why don’t you sign up for driver’s 
ed? 
PATRICK

LEE (CONT'D)

I’m not your chauffeur.

Because Dad made me promise 
not to drive til I was 
seventeen. 

OK. Then we’ll stick with that.

LEE (CONT’D)

EXT. SANDY & JILL’S HOUSE. NIGHT.
Lee’s car idles in front of the house.

PATRICK

You wanna stay for dinner? I think 
Sandy’s mother likes you. 

No she doesn’t.

LEE

PATRICK

Yes she does. This could be good 
for both of us.

87.

I’d really rather not.

LEE

PATRICK

Well, can you at least hang out 
with her so I can be alone with 
Sandy for half an hour without her 
mother knockin’ on the door every 
twenty seconds?

Come on, man.

LEE

PATRICK (CONT'D)

All you gotta do is talk to 
her! Why can’t you help me 
out a little bit for once 
instead of draggin’ me to the 
lawyers and the funeral 
parlor and the morgue? Anyway 
she’s really nice!

OK.

Thank you.

LEE

PATRICK

INT. SANDY’S HOUSE -- BASEMENT. NIGHT.

Patrick is practicing with his band. Sandy on lead vocals, 
the guys singing backup.

SANDY

"Tell me why -- Why do you need me? 
Why do you want me? / Why do you 
love me?"

PATRICK

Stop. Stop. 

Everybody stops playing.

PATRICK (CONT’D)

Otto, man --

OTTO

What? I'm too slow?

CJ

Too fast.

OTTO

I'm too fast?

88.

JOEL

Dude, you're like pullin’ outta the 
fuckin’ station ahead of me.

SANDY

Oh my God, you guys! Leave him 
alone.

CJ

Are you serious about this band or 
what?

OTTO

Get off my back.

CJ

All right, everybody just chill 
here. Let's just go again.

Everyone resets.

PATRICK

(into microphone)

We are Stentorian.

INT. JILL’S LIVING ROOM. NIGHT.
Lee and Jill are alone in the living room. She has a glass of 
wine. He has a beer. Silence.

JILL

Patrick’s one of my favorite 
people.

That’s good.

LEE

Silence. Jill twists around.

JILL

(Calls up the stairs)

How’s it goin’ up there, you guys?

Silence. Then there is some O.C. giggling and A DOOR OPENS.

SANDY 

PATRICK 

It’s going fine! Thanks! But 
we’re right in the middle of 
something!
There is more laughing and the DOOR SHUTS O.C.

Good! Really good! We’re 
totally rippin’ through those 
compound fractions!

89.

JILL

At least we know where they are, 
right?

LEE
That’s true...

INT. SANDY’S ROOM. SIMULTANEOUS.
Sandy comes away from the door. They are in their underwear. 
Patrick discards an unused, unrolled condom and GETS UP to 
get another from his pants, across the darkened room.

Hold on a sec.

PATRICK

SANDY

How many of those you generally 
gotta go through before you pick a 
winner?

PATRICK

I’d like to see you use one of 
these goddamn things with all these 
interruptions -- Ow!

He trips over something with a crash.

What happened? Are you OK? 

SANDY

PATRICK

I tripped over your fuckin’ doll 
house.

Oh my God, did you break it? 

SANDY

PATRICK

I don’t know. I’m fine though, by 
the way.

Sandy snaps the light on. 
SANDY

Oh my God. My grandmother gave me 
that when I was five years old. It 
was literally her doll house from 
when she was a little girl. 

PATRICK

Well what’s it doin’ on the fuckin’ 
floor?

90.

SANDY

It’s a doll house! That’s where you 
play with it!

Sandy? What is going on up there?

JILL (O.S.)

SANDY

Nothing! Patrick stubbed his toe on 
Mummer’s doll house, but it’s OK!

JILL

Sandy, that doll house belonged to 
my mother! 

SANDY

Yes I know, Mom! It was just 
an accident. Nobody’s 
smashin’ it to pieces! It’s 
fine!

JILL (CONT'D)

If you’re gonna smash it to 
pieces I wish you’d let me 
keep it somewhere else!

          PATRICK
Don’t worry, Jill, I’m OK! My 
toe’s gonna be OK!

INT. LIVING ROOM. NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS. 
Jill turns back to Lee, smiles and shrugs. Silence.

Could I get you another beer, Lee?

JILL

I’m good. Thanks.

LEE

Jill sips her wine. Lee can’t think of anything to say.

Would you excuse me, Lee, one sec?

JILL

Sure.

LEE

INT. SANDY’S ROOM. CONTINUOUS.
The only light comes from Sandy’s laptop. They’re on the bed.

Is it on?

SANDY

Yes. It’s a miracle.

PATRICK

OK. Hurry up.

SANDY

91.

JILL KNOCKS. Patrick and Sandy leap away from each other. 

Hey, Sandy? I’m sorry...!

JILL

           PATRICK
Goddamn it!

SANDY (CONT'D)

One second please! (To 
Patrick) Get outta my way!

AT THE DOOR, A MOMENT LATER -- Jill is talking to SANDY 
through a crack in the door. Patrick is pretending to work at 
the laptop. Sandy and he have pulled on their clothes.

What’s up?

SANDY

JILL

I’m really sorry, I know you’re 
trying to work, but I can’t sit 
down there much longer.

Why? What’s the problem? 

SANDY

JILL

He won’t talk. I’ve been trying to 
make conversation for half an hour!

SANDY
Are you serious?

JILL

I realize I’m not the most 
fascinating person in the 
world, but it’s very, very 
strained. 

PATRICK
What’s the matter?

          SANDY
Mom...

She can't make your Uncle speak.

SANDY

He likes sports.

PATRICK

JILL

I'm sorry to bust things up, 
but how much longer do you 
think you're gonna be?
I'm sorry...!

Sports? 

SANDY

          PATRICK
Can you talk about sports? 
Maybe there’s a game on you 
could watch.

Shut up. (To Jill) Mummy, Please.

 SANDY (TO PATRICK) (CONT’D)

92.

INT. LEE’S CAR (MOVING) NIGHT.
Lee drives Patrick home.

You were a tremendous help.

PATRICK

LEE

I didn’t ask to sit down there.

PATRICK

You can't make small talk like 
every other grown up in the world? 

PATRICK (CONT’D)

You can't talk about boring 
bullshit for half an hour? 
“Hey, how about those 
interest rates?” Hey, I lost 
my Triple A card?” Like 
everybody else? 

No. 

LEE

Nope. Sorry.

PATRICK

You're a fuckin' asshole.

INT. PATRICK’S ROOM. NIGHT.
Patrick is having trouble sleeping.

EXT/INT. LEE’S CAR (MOVING). DAY.

LEE

Where did she say she lives? 
Because there are like no houses 
here. None. Does she live in a 
fuckin' sleeping bag?

PATRICK

LEE

Pigeon Hill Street? Or Pigeon 
Hill Road? Pigeon Hill Court? 

PATRICK (CONT'D)

Pigeon Hill Street. Street! 
This is Pigeon Hill Road.

PATRICK (CONT’D)

You have no GPS whatsoever? 

LEE

No, I've got a little fuckin' 
cartoon moving map. 

93.

PATRICK

Do you want me to punch it in for 
you?

LEE

No, I don't. I've got it. Thank 
you. (Pause) Okay, listen. Are you 
nervous?

PATRICK
Yeah I’m nervous.

PATRICK (CONT'D)

What are you, a fuckin’ 
genius?

LEE

Because -- 
Skip it.

LEE (CONT’D)

Just...If anything gets weird, just 
text me, and I’ll come and get you. 

OK. (Pause) Thank you.

PATRICK

EXT. ELISE’S HOUSE. DAY.
They pull up to a small neatly kept house and get out. ELISE 
opens the front door. She looks starched and brittle.

Oh my gosh. Is that my Patrick? 

ELISE

Hi Mom.

PATRICK

ELISE

I’m so happy...! (To Lee) Welcome 
to my home.

INT. ELISE’S HOUSE. CONTINUOUS.
JEFFREY stands waiting as Elise ushers them in. He is in his 
late 40s, slight, well groomed and dressed in conservative 
weekend wear. Slacks, loafers, a light-weight sweater. LEE 
glances around the very tidy house. There is a framed pastel 
of Jesus on the wall. 

ELISE

Patrick. This is my fella. Jeffrey, 
this is Patrick...
JEFFREY

(Shaking hands)

Great to finally meet you, Patrick. 

PATRICK
Nice to meet you.

94.

ELISE

And this is Lee...

INT. ELISE’S DINING NOOK. DAY.
Patrick is at the table. Jeffrey and Elise bring in lunch. 

Oh -- Can I help with anything?

PATRICK

ELISE

No thanks, honey.
JEFFREY

Your job is to relax. OK? That is 
your A-Number One assignment.

OK. I’m gonna really apply myself.

PATRICK

No -- I was just joking. 

JEFFREY

I know you were. So was I.

PATRICK

Elise comes in from the kitchen and sits down.

How we gettin’ along?

ELISE

Great.

Great. 

JEFFREY

PATRICK

95.

ELISE

You don't have to be so polite, you 
know!

Oh -- I'm not bein’ polite...

PATRICK

ELISE

Did you wanna wash your hands 
before we eat?

Um -- Yeah.

PATRICK

INT. ELISE’S DINING ROOM. DAY.
Everyone is seated. Jeffrey is saying grace.

JEFFREY

For what we are about to receive 
let us give thanks. Amen.

ELISE

Amen.
Amen
They start passing around the lunch. 

PATRICK

ELISE

It’s OK to say Amen, Patrick...! 
Nobody’s tryin’ to recruit you!

PATRICK

I did say Amen.
ELISE

You did? OK. You don't have to...

PATRICK

I know. I just said it really 
quietly.

ELISE

Honey, it’s fine. I know -- I’m 
gonna be a shock to you. In a lotta 
ways. Hopin’ it’s a good shock...

Yeah...

PATRICK

What can I get you, Patrick?

JEFFREY

ELISE

I hope everything’s OK...(e.g. the 
lunch.)

96.

Oh yeah, it looks great. Thank you.

PATRICK

You don’t have to be so formal...!

ELISE

I’m not. 

PATRICK

I think Elise’s just --

JEFFREY

    

          PATRICK
That’s OK...

ELISE

I know...! I’m just sayin’, 
this is your home too!  I 
want it to be... It’s 
different from what you’re 
used to, but...And...I don’t 
know...! 

JEFFREY

What are you studying in school, 
Patrick?

Oh...well...The usual stuff...

PATRICK

ELISE

You know what? I’m gonna be right 
back. Anybody need anything from 
the kitchen?
JEFFREY

I think we’re good. No. 
Elise gets up and goes into the kitchen.

No, thanks. Thank you.

PATRICK

Did you get some string beans?

JEFFREY

Oh -- not yet. Thank you.

PATRICK

JEFFREY

OK. (Pause) Lemme just see what 
she’s doin’ in there.

He goes into the kitchen. Patrick eats.

INT. LEE’S CAR (MOVING) DUSK.
Lee is driving Patrick home. He glances at Patrick. Patrick 
is very glum and unhappy.

So what was she like?

LEE

97.

PATRICK

I don't know: She was pretty 
nervous.

What was the guy like?

LEE

He was very Christian.

PATRICK

LEE

You know we're Christian too, 
right? You are aware that 
Catholics are Christians?
They drive in gloomy silence.

PATRICK (CONT’D)

Yes, I know that. 

Yes I am aware of that.

LEE

Well...it sounds like she’s doin’ 
better anyway. She’s not drinkin’. 
She’s not in the psych ward.

PATRICK

Wow.

LEE

Wow what? 

What?

LEE

PATRICK (CONT'D)

You’ll do anything to get 
ridda me!

PATRICK

You heard me.
LEE

That’s not true. 

Patrick shrugs and starts texting on his iPhone.

INT. PATRICK’S ROOM. NIGHT.
Patrick sits at his laptop, wet from the shower. He opens an 
email from JEFFGARNDER7@YAHOO.COM. We see the first few lines 
and hear JEFFREY’S VOICE at the same time.

JEFFREY V.O.

“Dear Patrick, I’m writing on to 
thank you for today. Your visit 
meant the world to your mom. We are 
both deeply grateful for the love 
and trust you’ve shown by offering 
to rejoin her life. 

(MORE)

98.

JEFFREY V.O. (CONT'D)

But I feel it would be unfair to 
your mom to rush her along the long 
and challenging road ahead, and so 
I’m going to ask you to write to me 
in future to arrange any further 
visits. I hope you won’t find this 
to be --”

ON PATRICK as he reads on. He DELETES the MESSAGE.

INT. LIVING ROOM. NIGHT.
Patrick is watching an action movie on TV. Lee drifts in.

Where’s your friends tonight?

LEE

PATRICK

I don’t know.
LEE

Why don’t you call that girl Sandy 
and see if she’ll come over?

No thanks. Nice try, though.
Pause. Lee walks away and goes into --

PATRICK

INT. JOE’S DEN. NIGHT.
Lee turns on the light. He walks over to the fancy GUN CASE. 
It's got several expensive rifles mounted, and some HANDGUNS. 
Lee gets the key from on top of the case and opens it. He 
takes out a HANDGUN. Realizes that PATRICK is in the doorway.

Who are you gonna shoot? You or me?

PATRICK

LEE

Do you know how much these guns are 
worth?

A lot, I think.

PATRICK

LEE

Want to try to sell them and put 
the money toward a new second hand 
motor for the boat?

That’s a really good idea.

PATRICK

99.

EXT. GUN SHOP. DAY.
Through the window we see Lee and Patrick talking to the GUN 
SHOP OWNER. Joe’s guns are laid out on the counter on a felt 
cloth. The owner is counting out bills for them.

PATRICK

You wanna drive?

SANDY

Sure!

PATRICK

OK -- So --

The BOAT SWERVES WILDLY as Sandy takes the wheel.

PATRICK (CONT’D)
Yeah -- Don’t -- Just 
straighten her out -- OK.

SANDY

(Screams)

Oh my God! Sorry! 

She straightens the wheel and speeds up again.

Lee drives Sandy and Patrick into the driveway and stops.

EXT. WATERFRONT STREET. DAY.
Lee is walking toward his car. He slows because he sees RANDI 
pushing a stroller his way, with a newborn BABY in it. The 
baby is almost invisible inside his winter parka. Randi is 
accompanied by a friend, RACHEL, 40s.

Lee...! Hi.

RANDI

Hi.

RANDI

Um -- Rachel. This is Lee. Lee, 
Rachel. 

Hi.

RANDI
Well, could I -- I’d -- Could we 
talk a second? 

Sure. 

LEE

RACHEL

I’ll just pull around -- Just be 
like two minutes. 

OK, thanks.

RANDI

RACHEL
Nice to meet you.

You too.

LEE

Be right back.

RACHEL

Rachel hurries off and turns a corner. 

I don’t have anything big to say: 

RANDI

RANDI (CONT’D)

I just -- I know you been 
around -- 

And I thought -- we never -- 
Yeah I know. He seems like 
he's doin’ pretty well, 
considering. I mean...

That’s OK.

LEE

Yeah, I just been gettin’ 
Patrick settled in. 

I think he is...Yeah... 

RANDI

I guess you probably didn’t know I 
really kept in touch with Joe --

RANDI (CONT'D)

So it's been kinda weird for 
me, not seeing Patrick since 
he passed away -- Oh, OK. I 
didn’t know.

No, I knew that --

LEE

Well you can see him. I have no --

LEE (CONT’D)

102.

Could we ever have lunch?

RANDI

You mean us? You and me?

LEE

RANDI

Yeah. I, uh...Because...I said a 
lotta terrible things to you. But -- 
I know you never -- Maybe you don't 
wanna talk to me --

LEE

It’s not that. 
RANDI

But let me finish. However it -- my 
heart was broken. It's always gonna 
be broken. I know your heart is 
broken too. But I don't have to 
carry...I said things that I should 
-- I should fuckin’ burn in hell 
for what I said. It was just --

No, no...

LEE

RANDI

I’m just sorry. I love you. 
Maybe I shouldn’t say that. 
And I’m sorry --

LEE (CONT'D)

I can’t -- 

You can say it, but -- No, 
it’s just --I -- I can’t -- I 
gotta go.

We couldn’t have lunch?

RANDI

I’m really sorry. I don’t think so. 

LEE

You can’t just die...!

RANDI

But honey, I see you walkin’ 
around like this and I just 
wanna tell you -- 

But Lee, you gotta -- I don't 
know what! I don't wanna 
torture you. I just wanna 
tell you I was wrong.

That’s not true! Can't be 
true...!

LEE (CONT'D)
Thank you for sayin’ 
everything --I’m not! But I 
can’t -- I’m happy for you. 
And I want...I would want to 
talk to you -- But I can’t, I 
can’t...

I'm tryin’ to --
You're not. But I got nothin’ 
to -- Thank you for sayin’ 
that. But -- There’s nothin’ 
there ...You don’t 
understand...

103.

RANDI
Of course I do!

LEE

I know you understand...But I’ve 
gotta go -- I'm sorry.

OK. I’m sorry.

RANDI

LEE (CONT'D)

There’s nothin’ I can s -- I 
gotta go. 

He moves away. Randi breaks down.

INT. WATERFRONT BAR & GRILLE. DAY.
CU LEE, very drunk. He is at the counter of a busy local 
place full of fishermen eating and drinking their lunch. A 
new bunch of guys comes in loudly and boisterously. One of 
them accidentally clips Lee as the group passes by.

Pardon me.

FISHERMAN

LEE

It’s all right.

Lee whirls around and sucker punches the Fisherman. He goes 
down hard. His friends immediately grab at Lee en masse.

Hey! Hey! What’re you doin’? Etc.

FISHERMEN

Lee is pushed into some tables -- The whole place is in an 
uproar -- He is jumped by several guys. He keeps fighting 
crazily. Someone tries to pin his arms to stop the fight. 
Everyone is shouting.
GEORGE appears. He uses his size to shove the other guys away 
from Lee.

GEORGE

Break it up! Break it up! It's Lee 
Chandler. Lee! Let him go, Eddy. 
He's Joey Chandler's brother. Let 
him go! Lee. Lee! It's George. Lee. 
Come on -- (To the guys who beat 
Lee up) You won. OK? You won the 
fight.

Lee shoves George away and swings at the nearest man. 
Everybody pounces on him again. Someone hits Lee squarely and 
knocks him down. Now George is fighting everybody. Chaos.

OK, OK, OK!

GEORGE (CONT’D)

104.

INT. GEORGE’S LIVING ROOM. DAY.
Lee is dazed, lying on the sofa in George's cramped living 
room. George watches anxiously as George’s wife Janine 
finishes washing and bandaging Lee’s banged up face. George 
is a little banged up too.
JANINE

...Should we take him to the 
hospital?

I don't think so. Nothin’s broken.

GEORGE

JANINE

...What the hell did they hit him 
with, a fuckin’ baseball bat? 

GEORGE

They all just said he started 
swingin’. 

Lee wakes up.

LEE

Where’s Patrick?
GEORGE

He’s with the kids. I sent ‘em out 
for burgers. 
LEE

Lemme give you some money.

Lee sits up painfully and reaches for his wallet.

Lee. Please. It‘s my treat.

GEORGE

Lee stands up and fumbles for his wallet and drops it on the 
floor. George picks it up and gives it to him.

GEORGE (CONT’D)

Would you sit down please, for 
Christ’s sake?
LEE

OK.

Lee sits down and breaks into tears.

Come on, buddy.

GEORGE

George looks uncomfortable. He looks up toward the kitchen. 
Janine comes back in with coffee and sits next to Lee.

105.

I’m sorry...

LEE

That’s OK, buddy. It’s OK...

GEORGE

JANINE

Lee? Have some coffee. Come on. 
Drink this...

Lee takes the coffee and keeps crying. George and Janine 
exchange a look.

Lee is asleep on the sofa with a beer while the TV plays...A 
LITTLE HAND tugs at his SLEEVE. 

SUZY (O.C.)

Daddy? 

He turns his head and sees without surprise his DAUGHTERS 
seated next to him in their nightgowns. The BABY is in a 
playpen on the floor. SUZY, 7, is pulling his sleeve. Lee 
smiles at them.

LEE

Yes, honey? 

SUZY

Can't you see we're burning?

LEE

No, honey...You’re not burning.

LEE WAKES UP -- There’s SMOKE coming from the KITCHEN. 

INT. KITCHEN. DAY.

The blackened skillet is SMOKING. Lee comes in and puts it 
under the water in the sink. It hisses and steams.

PATRICK (O.S.)

Uncle Lee! What the hell’s that

Everything’s OK! 

He grips the sink and tries to recover from his dream.

PATRICK
What do you mean?

LEE

You don’t have to move to Boston. 
I’m gonna be in Charlestown and 
George is gonna take you. 

PATRICK

What? 

LEE

Yeah. I talked to them last week.
I explained the situation to them. 
Georgie Junior’s goin’ to school 
this fall. Jimmy graduates next 
year. We’ll have to rent out this 
house. You can move back in when 
you turn eighteen. When you turn 
twenty-one, you’re allowed to sell 
it or stay in it, or whatever you 
want. Definitely have to hire the 
boat out when the summer’s over -- 
just like we talked about. I 
thought when you get your license, 
we can figure that one out as we 
go. I'm still the trustee, but all 
the financial stuff Joe set up for 
me is gonna get transferred over to 
George.

LEE (CONT'D)

So everything’ll be the same, 
except you don’t have to move.

PATRICK

But...like, are they gonna be my 
guardians? Or do you still --

LEE

They’re gonna adopt you. (Pause)
Anyway, that's how I set it up. If 
you want. It's up to you.

PATRICK

So are you gonna just 
disappear? 

LEE (CONT'D)

You don’t have to do it. No. 
No. I just set it up so you 
can stay here. They’re really 
glad to have you. They love 
you. 

PATRICK

I know. I mean, they’re great...But 
why can’t you stay?

Patty starts crying.

LEE

Come on, Patty...I can’t beat it. 
(Pause) I can’t beat it. I’m sorry.

Patrick wipes his eyes. Lee comes over and hugs him. 

EXT. MANCHESTER STREET/ROSEDALE CEMETERY. DAY.

Patrick walks along the street. The TREES he passes have BUDS 
or BLOSSOMS. It’s early SPRING. He snaps a dead branch off a 
tree. He runs it across a fence as he walks. We REVEAL that 
he is headed for the cemetery gate. He goes into the 
cemetery.
He pokes his stick into the ground to see if it’s softened 
up. It has. He digs up some clods. He walks away.

EXT. AN OLD MANCHESTER HOUSE. DAY.
A MILNE PLUMBING & HEATING VAN is parked in the driveway.

INT. BASEMENT. DAY.
Lee is kneeling on the floor in coveralls, working on the hot-
water heater. The HOMEOWNER, in his 80s, stands by watching.

109.

What do you think?

HOMEOWNER

I think you’re gonna be OK.

LEE

HOMEOWNER

Are you one of Stan Chandler’s 
boys?

LEE
Yeah, I’m Lee.

HOMEOWNER

I used to play a little chess with 
your father a long time ago. He was 
a heck of a chess player.

That's him.

LEE

He's not still living, is he?

HOMEOWNER

No.

LEE

HOMEOWNER

And one of the sons passed away 
recently I heard. 

Yeah. Joe. My brother.

LEE

That's right. Very personable man.

HOMEOWNER

Yeah.

LEE

HOMEOWNER

My father passed away in 1959. A 
young man. Worked on a tuna boat. 
Went out one morning, little bit of 
weather, nothing dramatic...And he 
never returned. No signal. No 
Mayday. No one ever knew what 
happened.

Lee continues to work on the heater.

EXT. LAWYER’S OFFICE WINDOW. DAY.
Past the BLOSSOMS on the tree outside Wes’ window, we see 
GEORGE, LEE and WES, signing documents.

110.

EXT. JOE’S HOUSE. DAY.
There is a “FOR RENT BY OWNER” SIGN outside the house. Lee’s 
car is in the yard. Also Patrick’s bicycle. 

EXT. CEMETERY. DAY.
(MOS) Joe’s burial service. PATRICK, LEE, GEORGE and JANINE 
all stand in a row at the front. RANDI holds a CRYING BABY. 
She gives him to JOSH, who steps away. 

CU: CHANDLER TOMBSTONE. Engraved are the names of Lee's 
parents and now Joe. 

EXT. WIDE SHOT OF THE TOWN. DAY.
A beautiful early spring day. Lots of boats in the water.

EXT. MANCHESTER STREET -- CORNER GROCERY STORE. DAY.

Lee and Patrick walk up the street, still in their funeral 
clothes. 

PATRICK

I’m gonna get some ice cream. 

LEE

Go ahead.

PATRICK

Can I have some money?

LEE

Yeah.

Lee gives him a ten-dollar bill. Patrick goes inside. Lee 
picks up an old rubber ball from the ground and bounces it up 
and down. Patrick comes out with an ice cream bar.

EXT. MANCHESTER STREET. DAY.
Lee and Patrick trudge up a steeply inclined street. Lee 
occasionally bounces the ball.

PATRICK

So...When am I supposed to move in 
with Georgie?
LEE

July. I don’t even have a place to 
live yet. 

111.

Don’t they give you an apartment? 

PATRICK

LEE

Yeah, but I was gonna try to get a 
place with an extra room. Or room 
for like a pullout sofa. 

What for?

PATRICK

LEE

In case you wanna visit sometime. 
Or if you’re lookin’ at colleges in 
Boston or somethin’ and you wanna 
stay overnight...
PATRICK

I’m not goin’ to college.

LEE

All right, well then I'll have an 
extra room for all my shit. Do we 
have to talk about this now?

Nope.

PATRICK

He tosses away his ice cream stick.

After a minute Lee wipes his eyes. He bounces the ball and 
tosses it to Patrick. It goes wide and bounces crazily.

PATRICK (CONT’D)

Great throw. 
LEE

Just let it go. 

Patrick runs to gets the ball. They continue to walk up the 
hill, bouncing the ball across the street to each other and 
chasing it when it rolls back down the hill.

EXT. WIDE SHOT OF THE TOWN -- JOE’S BOAT. DAY.
Lee and Patrick head out to fish. Patrick drives the boat. 
Lee sets up the fishing gear. 

A FEW MOMENTS LATER -- Lee and Patrick are seated, fishing 
off the back of the boat. They talk quietly. Lee looks a 
little better than we’ve seen him. He squints at the sea and 
the wide open sky. 

FADE OUT.

THE END
