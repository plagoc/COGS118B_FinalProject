BOY ERASED 

Screenplay By

JOEL EDGERTON

Based on the memoir written by Garrard Conley 

1.

EXT. MEMPHIS SKY / CARPARK, 2004 - DAY

We hold on a big slice of MEMPHIS BLUE SKY. The only sound is 
the out of focus American flag whipped by wind in the 
distance. Soon after we hear, but don’t see -

A car pull up on the gravelled asphalt and -

The beeping of the door as it opens. From it spills the radio 
sounding out the ‘90s country hit -

‘Check Yes or No’  by George Strait.

GEORGE STRAIT

I think this is how love goes. 
Check yes or no.

And - a fresh faced young man, 18, stands up filling the 
frame, looking out into the distance. 

This is JARED EAMONS.

He wears an ultra crisp white shirt buttoned to the neck with 
no tie. He is slim and wears his hair cropped short.

The camera moves slightly to take in an out of focus church 
cross atop a basic baptist steeple ahead of him. All the 
while - that distant American flag, flapping in the breeze, 
flanks him from behind.

A second door opens O.S., spilling out that music again -

GEORGE STRAIT (CONT’D)
Now we’re grown up, and she’s my 
wife. Still like two kids and stars 
in our eyes.

- and now -

Jared’s mother NANCY steps into frame. She is made up to the 
nines: bottle blonde voluminous hair, hoop earrings and thick 
mascara. Underneath her heavy make-up we can see concern. 

She slides on Jackie O sunglasses and looks out toward the 
steeple as Jared turns toward the flag. They both seem lost. 
Nancy hides her concern behind the shades, tries a bright 
smile and, out comes her chirpy southern voice - 

NANCY

Are you ready, honey? 

Jared looks away for a beat, then turns with a convincing 
smile and starts walking. They leave frame.

2.

INT. L.I.A. FOYER - CONTINUOUS

L.I.A. is an acronym for ‘Love In Action’ -- But we should 
not know that yet. There is no signage.

Grey-blue carpet covers an expansive floor space. Stark white 
walls with no hangings or decorations. Some empty basic 
chairs lining one section of wall. Heavy doors lead off to 
unknown rooms. A potted plant in a corner seems an 
afterthought.

N.B.: For now we should see it as a dry, clinical facility. 
It should feel like a juvenile detention center of some kind.

-- Through the glass of the aluminum framed doors we see 
Jared and Nancy approach uncertainly - then enter.

Nancy’s ensemble is elegant, if not a little gaudy and 
mismatched: a Southern Belle dress and a shoulder padded 
coat. She wears heels and clutches a white bedazzled purse. 

Jared’s white shirt is tucked into a pair of brand new khakis 
with no belt. He wears rubber soled black shoes and holds a 
book in a blue plastic shopping bag.

They look an odd pair: A tall ‘Tammy Baker’ mother escorting 
her awkward, ultra conservative, son.

MALE VOICE O.S

I help you? What’s your name?

Nancy turns, taking her sunglasses off.

AARON (40s) stands inside a reception booth: Stocky, with a 
severe hair-cut, he puts a clipboard on the reception ledge. 

NANCY

Nancy.

AARON

The kid I mean. Unless you’re the 
one checking in.

Jared and Nancy, side by side at the reception desk, sign the 
clipboard document. Aaron stands erect with his authority 
inside the booth. He too wears khakis and a white shirt, 
along with a blue tie and a name badge. He sizes Jared up.

AARON (CONT’D)

Let’s get you checked in properly 
Jared. Wanna say your good-byes?

He comes out from the door of his reception booth.

3.

NANCY

Can I see the place?

AARON

Afraid you won’t be allowed beyond 
the reception area Missus Eamons. 
You can pick him up at five P.M.

On Nancy, uncertain --

JARED
It’s okay mom. 

NANCY

Call me if you need anything. I’ll 
be at the hotel and on my cell ph--

AARON

We’ll be holding his cell-phone. If 
there are any emergencies we will 
contact you. Otherwise, five P.M.

Aaron punches a code into the door and the door mechanism 
releases with a mechanical buzz.

Jared and Aaron pass through the secure door to a hallway, 
leaving Nancy waving nervously goodbye. 

INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Jared walks ahead as Aaron follows him. When Jared turns, the 
blank expression on Aaron’s face troubles him a little.

AARON

Door on the right.

They stop in front of the third door and Aaron knocks. Soon -

A tall, skinny blonde man (Michael, 24) answers the door. His 
shark grey, piercing eyes are almost permanently set in a 
judgmental frown, giving him a mean-streak air.

AARON (CONT’D)

Newbie. Eamons. 

INT. OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Michael picks through Jared’s possessions, scrutinizing each 
thing placed down: coins; cash; gum; a plastic hotel key-
card; the bag containing the book, and; his wallet. 

4.

He starts going through the wallet, while throwing the gum in 
the trash. Jared reacts.

Jared holds out his cell phone unsure who to give it to. 
Aaron takes it from Jared and puts it with the pile.

MICHAEL

Do you have any numbers or photos 
we need to be concerned about?

On Jared. Thinks. Shakes his head slowly. It reads like he is 
not convinced. Michael’s eyes drill into him. 

MICHAEL (CONT’D)

We will check this daily for any 
‘False Imaging’ and call any 
numbers we want to at random. So 
best you be straight with all this.

JARED

There is nothing... And yeah, call 
whatever numbers if you need to.

Michael, now back in the wallet, holds up a business card. 
And flips it... a handwritten cell number on the back.

MICHAEL

Who will answer if I call this 
number?

Umm. It is my doctor.

(beat)

JARED

It’s her off hours number. I forgot 
it was even there. 

MICHAEL

Anything else? 

Aaron starts to pat Jared down. He finds something --

JARED

Oh. Yeah. This. It’s... 

From his back waistband he pulls a moleskin notebook. Michael 
takes it and flicks through. It feels like a personal 
intrusion to Jared, who leans forward. 

JARED (CONT’D)

It’s just... I write stories 
sometimes. I’m at college studying 
and... I forgot cause it’s --

5.

MICHAEL

You have to start getting a better 
memory. Trust is one of the key 
words around here. No journaling. 
We’ll need to read this. Again, for 
any false imaging.

(to Aaron)

It’s almost nine. -

JARED

Sure. Will I get this stuff back?

MICHAEL

Most things you get back at the end 
each day.

JARED

That’s fine. It’s just stuff I -

Aaron starts to usher Jared out.

MICHAEL O.S

Forgetting something else?

Hold. Jared already feels in trouble. Then Michael takes 
Jared’s L.I.A. handbook from the plastic bag. On it we see a 
logo: an upside down triangle with a red heart in it.

MICHAEL

You need the handbook at all times. 
Good luck. 

JARED

Thank you.

It’s the only warmth Michael has offered thus far. Meager.

INT/EXT L.I.A. HALLWAYS - DAY

Jared is led by Aaron. As he turns the corner he looks back 
and sees another young person being led to the check in area.

- They walk out a door and under an awning toward a larger
building.

INT. L.I.A. MAIN AUDITORIUM - DAY

Jared, wearing a name tag, finds a seat and settles into a 
semi circle of chairs with TEN OTHERS: a half dozen teens and 
young people; a few in their twenties and thirties, and; one 
guy in his forties. Three women. Mostly boys. They all take 
out their handbooks. We take in their faces as we hear -

6.

- The rules read out, starting with Carl: super conservative
(25), likely taking time out his retail managerial position.

CARL

‘Sobriety. No smoking. No alcohol, 
or drugs.’  

And the CREDITS will appear over -

-- during the rules we will intercut with various historical 
religious paintings and other images --

The Last Supper by Dagnan-Bouveret, Jesus holds up a wine.

And now to Sarah... (tomboy-ish teenager - all of 16)

SARAH

‘Off hours. All clients to remain 
within the ‘Safe Zone areas as 
designated.’

Les Romains de la Décadence, Thomas Couture.

Credits continue over -- An aerial shot of Memphis. Then - 
shots of basic, boring diners and hotels. 

Family Portrait by Gillis van Tilborgh. NB: The withering 
look of the central bored male pilgrim facing the viewer.

Now - Cameron. Cropped hair. All of 17, he is a hulking line-
backer in the making with a baby face. He reads nervously.

CAMERON

‘Hygiene. Men to shave facial hair, 
and women to remove underarm and 
leg hair daily.’ 

Toilette der Esther - Théodore Chassériau, depicting an 
immoral woman with outstretched arms. No hair visible.

CREDITS continue as we move to LEE. Lee is the SLIM BOY who 
peeked at Jared in hall. Well: Lee is actually gender fluid. 
Non-Binary. Most people, in fact, would have a hard time 
being certain of Lee’s gender. Lee’s voice is no guide either 
way. It is soft and intelligent.

LEE

‘Attire. Men to wear long sleeves 
and pants at all times.’ 

Portrait of Jesus by Del Parson, where a blonde Jesus has his 
hands outstretched in an almost ‘you dig my robe?’ gesture.

7.

LEE O.S

‘Women’s skirts must extend below 
the knee and bras are to be worn at 
all times.’

The Virgin Mary in the Rose Garden - Albert Edelfelt 

We see a flash of a brassier catalogue: dry but sexual.

Now PHILLIP (30s. Balding and short. The guy from the hallway 
when Jared first arrived.)

PHILLIP

‘Visitations and phone calls to be 
pre-approved by L.I.A. staff.’ 

The Religious imagery continues. Credits too.

And over to SIMON (40. I.T. Worker type) 

SIMON

‘Confidentiality. All matters 
discussed in therapy are to remain 
private.’

The Last Supper: Leonardo Da Vinci. Close on whisperings.

ANDERS, 17, is fidgety and freckled.

ANDERS

‘Restrooms. Members must be 
supervised by staff during rest-
room visits.’

GARY (20s). Even under the crisp khaki and white uniform we 
can still tell he is a ‘Goth’: dyed black hair; pale 
complexion, and; black converse. He is slight of frame, 
handsome and super smart.

GARY

‘Sexual misconduct. No viewing of 
pornographic material.’ 

His reading carries a thinly veiled cynicism that tells us he 
does NOT believe L.I.A. and does NOT want to be here. 

Jan Breughel & Marshall Paul Rubens: The Garden of Eden. Then 
-

A flash of male pornography. 

8.

GARY (CONT’D)

‘No masturbation. No physical 
contact with any members or non 
members at any time apart from the 
briefest of handshakes.’ 

The Last Judgement by Michelangelo depicting men kissing men. 
Push in. We may keep returning to this image -

TINA, 27 - super conservative librarian’s hairstyle. Glasses.

TINA

‘False Imagery. Cell phones will be 
checked in and out each day. 
Without exception.’ 

We see flashes of pornographic images PLUS innocent images of 
men in modern society with their arms around each other. 

As the credits wind up it is Jared’s turn now.

JARED

‘Sinful, salacious and extraneous 
materials. All reading material, 
films and television are off limits 
while inside the program.’ 

Hold on Jared --

SYKES O.S 

Very good. Let’s leave it there.

Jared and the rest of the group respond to the voice. Someone 
new has entered. 

Closer on The Last Judgement - Michelangelo.

CREDITS END --

INT. L.I.A. MAIN AUDITORIUM

Tight on the various faces as they listen to --

SYKES O.S

‘I am using sexual sin and 
homosexuality to fill a God shaped 
void in my life.’

GROUP
(repeating)

‘I am using sexual sin and 
homosexuality to fill a God shaped 
void in my life.’

Jared looks around to see the DOZEN or more people that have 
entered and line the back walls. Various men and women of all 
ages. Mostly young. A similar cross section to the seated 
group.

9.

SYKES O.S

‘But... I am not broken and God 
loves me.’

They repeat.

SYKES O.S (CONT’D)

Somebody tell me what this is.

And finally Sykes steps into frame. A man in his mid-forties. 
Greying cropped hair. Piercing eyes. A blue shirt and black 
pleated trousers. The only one deviating from the dress code 
here. He holds up a dollar bill.

SIMON

A dollar.

SYKES O.S

No matter how much you crumple up a 
dollar bill, you can never take 
away its value. Even if you rip it, 
which would represent our being 
severed from Christ, you can tape 
it back together. 

Jared following the logic, soaking up all wisdom.

SYKES

Jesus puts us back together, and 
even though there is a scar, our 
value does not change. 

Behind Sykes is the only signage: The same ‘heart’ logo from 
the handbook cover.

Jared looks across at the androgynous boy, Lee. Out of 
everyone Lee seems the most terrified. 

SYKES (CONT’D)

You are somebody. You are worth 
something. And that’s a fact.

The door opens, interrupting Sykes, and in jogs a young, 
attractive boy in his late teens. Breathless.

SYKES (CONT’D)

Nine-O-five Jon.

10.

JON

Sorry. Had to run here. Apologies.

Jon takes a seat. Dressed the same as the rest of the group, 
his cowboy boots are the only thing that sets him apart. 

Jared can’t help but steal a look as Jon slouches in his 
chair. As Sykes continues, Jon hurriedly fixes the last 
couple of high buttons on his shirt. Sweat has rendered 
patches of the shirt see-through. Jon catches Jared looking, 
who turns away guiltily.

SYKES
Thank you Jon. 

(beat)

Well, I want to welcome all you 
brave souls. I know the road here 
wasn’t easy for many of you, but I 
promise you a smoother ride now 
that you are here. Welcome to ‘The 
Refuge’ program.

All of the men and women lining the walls follow Sykes’s lead 
in applauding the NEWCOMERS that are Jared’s group.

SYKES (CONT’D)

Okay, you guys. Get back to your 
schedules.

And with that, all of the men and women lining the walls 
start to file out. Jared watches them.

SYKES (CONT’D)

(to Jared’s group)

So we can get down to business.

He crumples the dollar bill and throws it to Cameron, who 
catches it. 

SYKES (CONT’D)

Don’t spend it all at once.

Jared feels buoyed by Sykes’s rhetoric and light energy in 
the room.

SYKES (CONT’D)

This may be the toughest but the 
most rewarding twelve days many of 
you will ever face.

(Jared and four others)

We have only one task. Simply to 
bring ourselves back to God. To 
invite Him back in. T’understand 
how he truly meant to create us. 

(MORE)

Before those pieces got torn away.

SYKES (CONT’D)

‘What sinful things have you done?’ 
And to ask God’s forgiveness. 

11.

(beat)

(beat)

(beat)

(beat)

Discover who made you this way. 
‘Who led you into sin?’

And get you on the right path to a 
life restored. 

I tell you, we are all about to go 
on a wonderful journey together. 
Who’s ready?
(smiles)

That was a question.

Everyone either raises their hands, nods, or utters ‘yes.’

SYKES (CONT’D)

If you are ready, say ‘Amen.’ 

EVERYONE/JARED

Amen.

SYKES

If you know you’re worth a dollar, 
say ‘Amen.’

Jared feels suddenly good and swept up in the new atmosphere 
in the room. For the first time we see him smile.

SNAP TO BLACK:

EVERYONE O.S

Amen.

--------------------------------------------------------------

TITLE: BOY ERASED

--------------------------------------------------------------

As the title disappears, a more personal silence develops. 

JARED O.S

Please Lord, make me pure.

INT. L.I.A MAIN AUDITORIUM - MID MORNING

It’s tea break. Jared sips tea as he looks around.

- Sykes speaks to a fellow staff member.

12.

- Sarah sits alone, eating cut carrots and celery.

- Lee sits doing nothing. Totally lost.

- Nearby, Jon talks with Carl; the super conservative
managerial type. Then Jon salutes him in a casual, military
style. During this Jon and Jared catch eyes.

Sykes claps his hands together.

SYKES

Okay. Bring it in.

Jared approaches his chair. Next to him is the VERY large and 
very young, linebacker-type, CAMERON. A gentle giant. 

The sneakers, the calloused hands, and the crew cut suggest 
he was probably blocking a touchdown rush last Friday night 
to the roar of his high school home crowd. Now, for reasons 
that he seemed to be puzzling in his head, he had found 
himself locked in at L.I.A.: The roaring stadium bleachers 
now replaced by a prison.  

Jared and Cameron acknowledge each other. He is painfully 
shy, clutching his L.I.A. handbook, wishing it was just his 
team’s playbook. Something he fully understood.

Jared catches eyes again with Jon, who gives him a mini 
salute.

SYKES O.S.

Who can tell us what a Genogram is?

INT. L.I.A. MAIN AUDITORIUM - AFTERNOON

On the group. Finally, Phillip raises his hand. 

PHILLIP

A Genogram is like a family tree. 
Only, one that shows patterns of 
family behavior as well. But, like, 
an illustrated one.

SYKES

Someone read the handbook. Thank 
you, Phillip.

Michael moves through the room with big sheets of butcher 
paper and plastic tubs of colored sharpies for each member.

13.

SYKES (CONT’D)

A Genogram shows hereditary 
patterns and behavioral clues in 
our families. It traces the history 
behind our sinful behavior.

(beat)

Be as expressive as you will, but 
write a list or draw these folk in 
your family. Anyone of influence to 
you as you grew up too. Blood or 
otherwise. First sexual partners 
even. Teachers. Coaches.

Jared looks across at the other members, curious of their 
various stories and histories.

Sykes goes to a board where Michael is furiously writing up a 
list of ‘behaviors.’ 

SYKES (CONT’D)

Then write next to these people, 
their sins --

All members, old and young, start to sprawl out on the ground 
like children drawing. Jon and Sarah, already familiar with 
the task, are writing out family names and drawing etc...

SYKES (CONT’D)

Michael --

Michael’s sounds out the codes. 

MICHAEL O.S.

A. Alcoholism. P. Promiscuity. H
for homosexuality. D for drugs.  A
Money sign for Gambling. M for
mental illness. Big A little b for
abortion. G slash C for gang or
crime involvement. Big P little o
for pornography.

Jared looks to big Cameron as he writes slowly -- M..o..m

SYKES

You’re forgetting... oh ‘Dv.’ 

MICHAEL

Oh, sorry. Big D little v for 
domestic violence.

Cameron now adds ‘Dv’ next to his Dad.

14.

SYKES

Call them out in your Genogram. 
Because I can guarantee, and you 
may not even realize it yet but, 
one or some of these people are to 
blame for why you are here.

Jared looks down at his page. He has listed - Dad, Mom, 
Grandpa W, Grandma W. Nan. Poppy. Uncle Chris. Aunt Minny. 
Now, his hand wavers over what to mark any of them as. 
Sykes’s feet step before Jared’s poster. 

SYKES O.S.

Search your mind and you’ll find 
something.

Sykes crouches down. Jared, out of fear of coming up blank, 
writes ‘A?’ Next to Uncle Chris.

SYKES

You know or you don’t know. ‘Uncle 
Chris is an alcoholic.’

Jared erases the ‘?’. He looks at Sykes’s feet, thinks, and 
then writes Chloe... ‘P’ - (promiscuous)

PRE-LAP - The roar of a crowd.

INT. ST. MARTIN’S AUDITORIUM - NIGHT (FLASHBACK - 2003)

Packed bleachers out of focus. Then in poetic slow motion we 
see a BEAUTIFUL YOUNG CHEERLEADER fly into frame. A sequined 
red, white and blue uniform with a big ‘M’ on the chest. She 
throws a shape in slow motion, beaming a THOUSAND WATT smile.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Title card : CHLOE

--------------------------------------------------------------

Gravity takes her away again, but soon she is back, bending 
into an even more brilliant and dynamic shape.

WAYNE O.S

Chloe wants to have sex with you.

She lands now, in real time and the sound returns to normal. 

Jared sits on the bench, leaning into his friend Wayne. He 
didn’t hear. Basketball players press in front of them.

15.

WAYNE

I said Chloe is down to do it. 
She’s been asking Mindy and Mindy 
has been positive for obvious 
reasons. So you can thank me.

Before Jared can respond - The buzzer rings sounds and the 
St. Martin’s Colonels, basketball team are in a GROUP HUG.

Soon, friends and family members are among them offering 
congratulations.

Jared’s parents approach. We recognize Nancy but his dad we 
will now meet: MARSHALL. He limps over in a mismatched blazer 
and pants. A sturdy man in his 50s.

NANCY

Yay!!! You set up so many points. I 
saw -

MARSHALL

- Most underrated component of the
game, assists. And you scored some
too. Congratulations.

A handshake turns into a hug. A rare commodity.

MARSHALL (CONT’D)

That’s victory sweat.

NANCY

Eww.

JARED

I only played five minutes.

Chloe approaches --

CHLOE

Yay!! Congratulations!!! Woo-hoo!!!

She hugs Jared still holding her pom-poms.

MARSHALL

(lights up re: Chloe)

And weren’t you something. Another 
underrated component of the game.

Nancy playfully hits her husband.

MARSHALL (CONT’D)

Moral support. Seriously. How high 
up were you just now?

16.

NANCY

We were worried. What if they 
dropped you?

Chloe takes Jared’s hand. 

MARSHALL

You kids going to celebrate?

Marshall holds up a Ford key. It’s a big deal, his father 
giving him the keys to the car.

MARSHALL (CONT’D)

It’s yours.

(off Jared’s surprise)

The dealership are putting me in a 
new Explorer Sport. You deserve it. 
Have fun.

Jared launches in to hug his dad. Chloe joins.

MARSHALL (CONT’D)
It was going to be for your 
birthday. Congratulations.

JARED

Wayne!!

He holds up the keys to his teammate and friend, Wayne.

MARSHALL

No more people than it has seat 
belts.

INT. JARED’S ‘02 FORD MUSTANG - NIGHT. ARKANSAS. SUMMER.

A JAMMED CAR. Just the opposite of what his father ordered.

Jared and Chloe ride up front. In the back are two couples: 
Wayne and Mindy, along with Lance and Cheryl.

As they pass parked cars, and kids walking, we see a LAKE in 
the B.G. KIDS are already stripping down and jumping in. 

They park and everyone goes to get out. Chloe pulls Jared 
back for a kiss. After a couple of attempts he pulls away.

JARED

Come on.

17.

EXT. LAKE - NIGHT

A sprawl of wet, undressing youth all in bathers or 
underwear.

Jared strips down and heads for his teammates who are already 
splashing in the water. He passes -

A flat-bed truck that is reversed close to the water’s edge. 
A couple of guys are trying to set up speakers. Meanwhile - 

Chloe and the girls undress more carefully, hanging clothes 
in trees or folding them into neater piles.

Then the music BLARES, received with a victorious cry. Bring 
Me to Life - Evanescence. Another cheer rings out simply for 
the choice of song. Through the opening riff -

The girls continue to undress while -

In the lake other kids start to ‘air-drum’ to the song.

Jared and his mates tune in too, all playing their air 
guitars. Then, as the song shifts gear, Wayne splashes Lance 
and the others and they start to wrestle and play-fight -

Jared jumps into the fray, grappling with Wayne, fully 
committing to the camaraderie. Then - Wayne breaks free.

WAYNE

Holy.... Dude. Check it out.

And then Jared turns to see -

- what would normally make any teenage boy quiver 
immediately: Chloe in a white bra and panties, semi see-
through when wet. She is full breasted and wading, barely hip 
deep, in the water. The boys all stare - at the trio of 
girls: pure teenage fantasies wading in the lake. Jared turns 
back to the guys.

WAYNE (CONT’D)

Bro. What’s wrong with you? Go. Go. 
That’s the trophy.

The guys all push Jared toward Chloe. It’s a slow approach.

WAYNE (CONT’D)

You know white is see through when 
it’s wet Chloe? 

A few chuckles from the boys.

18.

CHLOE

I heard that laugh before. I think 
on a documentary about hyenas... 
that were retarded. And their 
retarded friends.

Jared laughs like a goof at Chloe’s joke.

WAYNE

You may as well take it off, cause 
we can pretty much see it all.

CHLOE

Shall I..? Okay...

(she teases)

Oh, But I wouldn’t want you guys to 
pollute the water with all your...

WAYNE

Say it. You can’t even say it.

CHLOE

Cum. 

Shock. Off Wayne’s expression she turns to the girls.

CHLOE (CONT’D)

See. He just did I bet. You guys 
actually have hard-ons right now 
don’t you?

Blank expressions. Wayne gives an ‘as if’ response.

CHLOE (CONT’D)

Prove it?!

Long pause. Jared certainly doesn’t have a hard-on but 
wonders if he should. Chloe won’t let up.

CHLOE (CONT’D)

Stand up properly. All of you.

None of them are willing. Finally Lance goes up on his tip-
toes. We don’t see it but Chloe must be right because Mindy 
stifles a laugh and Cheryl turns away with an ‘Ewwww.’ Lance 
drops back down into the water. He doesn’t care.

LANCE

Damned if you do. Damned if you 
don’t.

Then - Chloe splashes Jared, breaking the tension and they 
all start to wrestle, thrashing in the water.

EXT. LAKE-SIDE BEACH BONFIRE - NIGHT

Jared and Wayne by the bonfire. Lance and Nick dress close 
by. Wayne offers sage advice on sex -

19.

JARED
What’s it like?

WAYNE

We’ve done it four times now.

Jared nods. His friend is an expert.

WAYNE (CONT’D)

It’s pretty awesome dude. I have to 
say. I mean, I’m sure it’d be even 
better just relaxing on a nice bed 
instead of in the corner of a barn 
or in some dark closet with an 
actual real fear of getting caught 
and shot by Mr. Riggs. But -
Even still, it’s a-mazing.

(beat)

It’s like being in a place you’ve 
been told over and over is bad and 
then you get in there and you are 
like - ‘how is this bad? I wanna be 
in here forever.’

LANCE

Like White Castle.

NICK

Like eating a burger??

Like shut up.

LANCE 

NICK (CONT'D)

You compared sex with a girl 
to eating shitty food.

Lance punches Nick and Nick returns fire. Soon they are up 
wrestling each other. Wayne and Jared.

LANCE O.S.

Get off me, fag. Faggot!!

WAYNE

It’s warm. And it gives you this 
amazing great feeling.

I bet yeah

JARED

(MORE)

JARED (CONT'D)

20.

WAYNE

Plus, man. Listen. This whole no 
sex before marriage thing... would 
your dad expect a customer to buy a 
car without test-driving it? See. 
You almost have to try it.

(good point)

You won’t wanna stop dude. 
Seriously. Try it. You’ll see.

This lands with Jared. The thought that maybe sex with Chloe 
could make him snap out of his thoughts aimed at men. He 
looks across at her on opposite side of the fire. She has 
finished dressing and wears his hoody.

INT/EXT JARED’S FORD / CHLOE’S FAMILY HOME - NIGHT
Elton John’s - “Sad songs said so much” plays as Jared pulls 
up to Chloe’s family home. Their hair is still wet.

CHLOE

Go back behind the tree.

JARED

I should get home. I -

CHLOE

We are fifteen minutes early.

He reverses so a large maple tree blocks the view from the 
house to the car. She immediately starts to kiss him. Jared 
engages. Then his eyes open, looking down --

A hand, Chloe’s hand, is on his thigh. He stops her.

CHLOE (CONT’D)

What? I just wanna touch it. 

(beat)

On the outside.

Jared keeps his hand on hers.

CHLOE (CONT’D)

If it’s not hard, I can make it 
hard.

JARED

We should wait for that kind of -

20A.

I’m not asking you to put it inside 
me, Jared. I just wanna feel it 
through your jeans

CHLOE

21.

CHLOE (CONT'D)

. Wayne and Mindy have gone all the 
way and they didn’t get struck by 
lightning or put in prison. Cheryl 
has put at least three in her mouth 
that I know of. 

JARED

Cheryl?

CHLOE

I just wanna feel it.

JARED

If we start that, then it’s gonna 
be hard to stop. I want to but 
shouldn’t we wait until, you know -

CHLOE

You asking me to marry you? 

(beat. Silence)

That’s what my parents think should 
happen. To keep us together through 
college.

Jared is at a loss for words. Then Chloe tries one more time. 
He stands his ground. She sits back defeated and opens the 
door.

CHLOE (CONT’D)

What is wrong, Jared?

Jared is left alone, aware this is an escalating issue.

INT. EAMONS FAMILY HOME - JARED’S BEDROOM - DAY

Jared, shirtless, staring at a screen. He types something 
quickly and bites his nails and checks the door.

Circa 2004 downloads were not so fast so it starts with the 
top inch of a man’s face then, five seconds later, the neck 
and bare shoulders. A slow motion strip tease. 

NANCY O.S

Jared honey?

Jared tries to shut the screen but gets the ‘spinning wheel’ 
The image is stuck halfway. He tries again but the image 
downloads one bar further. Nancy approaches. Thinking quick 
he turns the screen to black.

I’m starting a new painting. Which 
one do you like best

NANCY

(MORE)

NANCY (CONT'D)

22.

She holds up two images (both of the family). He picks one 
She stays there continuing to look at the photos.

JARED

Mom, I’m getting dressed.

On her way out.

NANCY

Make sure you pack for Dallas. I 
think your father wants to go 
straight from church tomorrow. 

Nancy leaves. Did she see or not see the glistening muscular 
man in the underpants ad? He brings the screen up again. The 
image, no longer enjoyable, is a just source of guilt.

INT. EAMONS FAMILY HOME - LATER

Marshall sits at the breakfast table. Jared shuffles in 
dressed in a similar shirt. Jared goes to the fridge. 

MARSHALL

We’ll detail that car today.

JARED

Dad, seriously, it’s so awesome.

Are you ready? I’ll ride with you --

MARSHALL

JARED

Why are we actually going to 
Dallas?

MARSHALL

The architect has updated the 
remodelling plans for the ministry 
and we are taking a tour of two 
similar churches there.

JARED

Do you think I could stay at 
Chloe’s when you go instead?

(Off Marshall’s look)

It’s okay. I can stay at Wayne’s or 
I’ll just come. I’ll just come.

I’m okay with you staying there, if 
they are. I think it’s a good idea

EXT. EAMONS FAMILY HOME  - DAY

Jared and his father get in Jared’s car as Nancy waves to 
them. She is setting up her easel and paints beside 
Marshall’s other hobby: a restored ‘65 Chevy Pick-Up.

MARSHALL O.S.

You are both mature kids.

EXT. INDUSTRIAL COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

Jared’s car turns into the Ford dealership. 

INT. EAMONS’S FORD DEALERSHIP - DAY

Jared walks through the dealership following his father. 
Jared shakes Big Jim’s hand and is greeted by other workers.

MARSHALL O.S.

Who know how to conduct themselves -

MARSHALL

Big Jim. Lead us in prayer today?

JIM

Be proud to Captain. Jared.

MARSHALL O.S.

- and who know by now how the world
works.

INT. DEALERSHIP FLOOR - LATER

There among the display cars Jared, Jim, AND FOUR OTHER CO-
WORKERS, lock arms in prayer.

JIM

Dear Heavenly Father. Thank you for 
this day filled with sunshine --

INT. LUNCH ROOM - DAY

Jared devours ‘To Kill a Mockingbird’ over lunch --

24.

MARSHALL O.S.

You gotta learn to take small steps 
toward manhood, so that you don’t 
have to run, panicking, when it 
suddenly arrives.

Across the table, a voluptuous female employee eats lunch 
reading a magazine. Jared shares an awkward smile with her.

INT. FIRST NATION BAPTIST MINISTRY - DAY

On Jared, flanked by Nancy, watches Marshall preach. 

MARSHALL

Let’s see a show of hands --

Wayne, who sits next to Jared, palms him something. A condom. 
He winks. Jared is mortified.

MARSHALL (CONT’D)

Who knows they are imperfect?

Everyone’s hands go up. Jared swaps the condom in his hands 
to comply with all the hands firing up in the air.

MARSHALL (CONT’D)

And those that are?

No hands - a polite chuckle from the congregation -

MARSHALL (CONT’D)

Well, that seems like the perfect 
segue to my introduction. Jesus 
spoke to me the day I saw this man 
first speak, and said ‘listen to, 
and learn from, this man.’ Which I 
have done every week in this very 
church. He has helped me immensely 
and given me the strength to start 
my own mission at Mountain Home. 

Jared catches eyes with Chloe -

25.

MARSHALL (CONT’D)

He’s about as perfect as any man 
can get in this world and in his 
true service to the Lord. My 
mentor, Pastor Lynn Marks.

He passes the mic to the elder Pastor. Marshall then sits in 
front of Jared and turns with a smile and a weird high-
five/handshake. Pastor Wilkes climbs the stairs.

PASTOR

Everybody stand up. On your feet.

And such is Pastor Wilkes’ power: the congregation stand.

INT. CHLOE’S FAMILY HOME - NIGHT

Jared sits for dinner with Chloe, her parents ERIC and BRANDY 
and her fifteen-year-old brother CHRISTOPHER. Secretly, Chloe 
reaches her leg out to touch Jared’s thigh.

ERIC

So a semester at Lyon, and then 
Chloe was saying you hope to bridge 
over to U.N.C by next year? 

JARED

Yes, sir. They have a great writing 
program. Journalism really 
interests me -

ERIC

Well. We’ll have to find ways to 
keep you guys connected.

Looks all around. The conversation is loaded. 

OMITTED

INT. CHRISTOPHER’S BASEMENT BEDROOM - NIGHT

It’s dark. Jared sits up to check on a sleeping Christopher. 
His phone receives a vibrating text -

CHLOE 

‘??? come up’

25A.

JARED

(texting back)

‘okay.

JARED (CONT'D)

26.

INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT

Jared moves ever so quietly up the stairs. But then -

CHRISTOPHER O.S.

Where you think you’re going?

Jared frozen, turns to see Christopher. Sprung.

INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT

Jared plays Dynasty Warriors III with Christopher. The music 
is synthesized and upbeat.  The character, Zhang, looks like 
an Asian rock prince, clad in purple silks, wearing a slick 
hair topped by a tiara. He swings a four pronged sword.

CHRISTOPHER

What do you think of him? What’s-
his-face, Zhang He, there with his 
girly crown and pony tail in the 
purple outfit moving around like a 
dancer.

JARED

Yeah. It’s a bit much.

CHRISTOPHER

A bit gay don’t you think?

Jared looks at Christopher.

CHRISTOPHER (CONT’D)

Don’t you think?

They stare at each other. Something shared in the look. 
Dangerous and also tender. There is a wisdom to Christopher 
for a younger kid. The silence broken only by a text message. 

CHRISTOPHER (CONT’D)

You wanna go and fool around with 
my sister, I ain’t gonna stop you.

Hold.

26A.

INT. CHRISTOPHER’S BASEMENT BEDROOM - NIGHT

Jared stares at the ceiling, then finally turns to fall 
asleep. He’s given up the attempted mission.

CUT TO

27.

INT. L.I.A. MAIN AUDITORIUM - AFTERNOON (PRESENT)

Jared stands back from his Genogram and stretches. He making 
some notes on his L.I.A. notebook.

INT. L.I.A. ADMIN OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON

Jared is handed a zip-lock bag containing his possessions by 
Michael. Jared opens his phone, just to check it.

MICHAEL
Tomorrow at nine.

Jared starts to walk toward the exit, as Michael moves back 
down the bowels of L.I.A. Jared turns, holding his Moleskin.

JARED

Um. Hey. You tore out the pages -

MICHAEL

False Imaging.

Jared looks at the book with the pages crudely ripped out.

JARED

They’re just... stories.

Sykes will decide that.

MICHAEL

EXT. L.I.A. - AFTERNOON

Jared comes out quietly fuming, holding his bag of items. Jon 
is on the steps waiting. Jared sits a little way off. 

JON

Whatever they took, you’ll probably 
get it back. Don’t sweat it. 

Jared tries to let it go.

JARED

Were you in the military? I saw you 
salute. I thought --

Oh. That. No. I could do the whole 
handshake thing. I’m just trying 
zero contact what-so-ever. 

JON

(MORE)

Twenty-three days now. So I -

JON (CONT'D)

(he salutes)

Salute instead

(MORE)

27A.

28.

JON (CONT'D)

Jared nods awkwardly.

JON (CONT’D)

Sure it don’t feel like it right 
now maybe but you’ll love it here.  
You get all sorts but this group 
seems good. 

JARED

Have you been here before?

JON

It’s my second go round in the 
Refuge Program. I started a couple 
days late last time and -

(beat)

I’m actually waiting for a place to 
open up in one of the houses.

JARED

What houses?

JON

Down the back there, past the fence 
they got a couple houses for the 
long-stayers. New Hope house for 
the men. One for the women too.

Those others you saw earlier today, 
most of them stay there. 

(points)

(beat)

Meanwhile, I’m at the Best Western 
while I wait for my spot. Assuming 
you’re staying at one of the local 
‘safe zone’ hotels with a relative 
too? 

Jared takes this in.

JARED

How long will you stay for?

JON

That’s not really up to me. Sykes 
decides - sometimes six months. Or 
else a year. You eighteen? 

JARED

Just. Yeah.

JON

Then you can stay at the houses.

Off Jared’s look -

28A.

29.

JON (CONT’D)

Nobody explained that to you? This 
is just an assessment program, The 
Refuge. To see what to do with you 
next.

Just then - the doors open and out walks Sarah flanked by 
Aaron on one side and an older man, possibly a stepfather, on 
the other. Everyone watches as she gets ‘put’ in the car like 
an escorted prisoner. Jon takes it in.

JON (CONT’D)

Should’a seen her arrive this 
morning. She’ll be fine. Like I 
said: ‘all sorts.’ Some are ready 
for it. Some not.

This hangs. Is Jared there by choice or by force?  He catches 
eyes with Gary who leans against the fence.

JON (CONT’D)

Lean into it man. It’s the only way 
to do it and win. S’only way it’s 
possible. Just lean in.

(beat)

And it is possible. If you’re on 
your heels you’ll lean too far away 
and fall backwards into hell again. 
No point not leaning in when you 
get given the chance. 

Jared absorbs Jon’s optimism. He already has identified him 
as someone to look up to. 

JARED

Yeah. No. I’m excited to be here.

Suddenly Nancy pulls up and leans out the window -

NANCY

Hey! How was it? Was it fun and 
interesting?

Jared stands up, a little embarrassed. She waves to Jon -

NANCY (CONT’D)

Hi. I’m the Mom.

(no response)
I’ll turn around.

Nancy starts the turn as Jared gets set to leave -

30.

JARED

You need a ride? I think we’re just 
near the Best Western.

JON

Someone’s on their way to grab me. 
Thanks though. And don’t sweat the 
things they took. Lean in. Think of 
the bigger picture.

He salutes from his perch and Jared starts off -

Jared passes Cameron who gets into his Dad’s suburban S.U.V. 
At a first glimpse, CAMERON’S DAD, a wealthy man, looks like 
an ex-football player.

JARED
See ya Cameron.

Cameron turns sweetly, flattered to be acknowledged. But his 
father turns sharply to assess Jared. 

INT. NANCY’S CAR - AFTERNOON

Nancy’s car pulls onto the highway, into the dimming Memphis 
sunlight, toward the glowing row of cheap hotel lights.

Jared winds down the window and puts his arm out, dancing in 
the breeze.

NANCY

Please don’t do that. I’ve told you 
that makes me nervous. What if a 
truck comes and...

JARED

That is never going to happen.

NANCY

It’s happened before. It has. 

He pulls his arm back in and winds the window up.

INT. HAMPTON INN AND SUITES RESTAURANT - DUSK/NIGHT

Jared and his mother eat. She keeps looking at him. Jared 
puts his fork down decisively as if to say ‘what?’ --

Well? I wanna know about your day

NANCY

(MORE)

31.

NANCY (CONT'D)

JARED

We’re not meant to talk about it 
outside of group. 

NANCY

I don’t need gossip. You can speak 
generally.

JARED

I’m going to lean into it. And 
there are some good people, and 
yeah. I like it.

They go back to eating, Nancy relieved. He seems happy. Jared 
thinks a beat and finally takes a piece of paper from his 
pocket and places it beside Nancy’s plate.

JARED (CONT’D)

Do we have people in the family who 
had issues with any of this stuff.

Nancy examines it, getting her reading glasses.

NANCY

‘Pornography?’

The people at the booth behind turn and she lowers her voice.

NANCY (CONT’D)

‘Drugs.’ ‘Gang affiliations?!’ What 
is this?

JARED

I need to know for homework.

NANCY

Gang affiliations?

OMITTED

INT. HAMPTON INN AND SUITES HALLWAY - DUSK/NIGHT

Jared and his mother walk the long hall to the room.

NANCY O.S.

Why does the family matter? Our 
family is so... normal.

As Nancy enters the room, Jared clocks Sarah and her 
stepfather a little way down the hall

32.

INT. HAMPTON INN AND SUITES ROOM - NIGHT

Jared puts his schedule on the wall. He takes his L.I.A. 
handbook and homework and piles them on the nightstand. He 
weighs his own books he brought for the stay -- now certainly 
‘off limits.’ About to place them in the trash, he thinks 
better of it and piles them over on his mother’s nightstand.

Nancy enters from the bathroom and places a piece of paper on 
the top of his L.I.A. handbook: Jared’s Genogram homework. 

NANCY

Sleep well. Big day tomorrow.

As she walks away, he examines the paper.

NANCY (CONT’D)

I was only with the gang for a year 
or so... Until I went down for 
drugs, and got sent to prison.

JARED

Ha ha.

Jared leans over and switches off the lamp. Then after a 
pause in the near darkness we hear -

NANCY O.S.

I put your Uncle Victor down there. 
We never see him. He moved to 
Louisiana. We always figured he 
might have been... well, he was 
very feminine-like you might say.

Jared stares at the ceiling, the traces of light outlining 
his face.

SYKES O.S.

What is a real man?

INT. L.I.A. MAIN AUDITORIUM - MORNING

CLOSE ON JARED’S GENOGRAM. It now has a handful of ‘A’s added 
and ‘Dm’ in both grandparents lines. And a new BOLD 
addition... UNCLE VICTOR -- ‘H.’ (Homosexuality)  

SYKES O.S.

What defines a ‘real’ man?

Close on Cameron’s child-like drawing of his dad: Brutish.

33.

SYKES O.S. (CONT’D)

Perhaps being close to the flames 
of hell and finding your way back 
forges a great strength --

Jared and the others pin their work to the back wall. From 
his position near the big open door, Jared can see the fence 
line outside: A big black Chevy pickup parks outside.

OMITTED

INT. L.I.A. MAIN AUDITORIUM - DAY

Close on the members of the group as they keenly watch the 
‘newcomer.’

SYKES O.S.

And if so... if this isn’t a real 
man, I don’t know what is.

Sykes is almost too excited to introduce their guest staff 
member. And we finally see him -

SYKES

Meet Brandon Ellis. 

There is no mistaking, Brandon is a hard man, who’s lived a 
hard life, and walked a hard road. That 1% that makes most 
self-proclaimed men feel ‘less than.’

SYKES (CONT’D)

Over to you Brandon.

Sykes tries a tough-guy handshake. It is comfortable on 
Brandon. Not with Sykes. 

BRANDON

Thanks Sykes. Mighty kind of you 
and... God bless.

(beat)

A ‘real man’ to me is a man of God 
first and foremost. I’m a man of 
God no doubt. But, I wasn’t once. 
If I was ever listed on my own 
son’s Genograms - God forbid I was 
and that he were here -

In that comment we see not just Brandon’s thinly veiled 
disgust for homosexuality

34.

BRANDON (CONT’D)

- But if I was: Drugs. Violence.
Prison time. Gang crime...  I’d
have so many letters next to my
name, it would look like
qualifications from some
university.

(pause for effect)

And I actually believe that to be 
true. I’m qualified to be here, not 
maybe because I have ever had the 
kinds of thoughts and feelings that 
y’all are wrestling with. Or that 
your other guidance counselors have 
overcome. 

There is the disgust again. PLUS it dawns on Jared that most 
of the staff may be ex-gay. He steals a look at Sykes.

BRANDON (CONT’D)

But I’ve had all sorts of my own 
trials that took me so far from the 
Lord, it is a true miracle that I 
am standing here before you. But I 
am. 

INT. L.I.A. SHORT BUS - DAY

Jared and the gang all ride the short bus. Brandon and Sykes 
flank the aisles near the front. Aaron drives. We are not 
sure where they are headed. Jared turns for a moment and 
looks down the aisle - perhaps to see Jon.

INT. OUTDOOR FOOTBALL FIELD - DAY

The whole group are in a line. Brandon moves along spreading 
the guys’ stances wider, and correcting posture while Sykes 
and Aaron and the girls sit on the concrete bleaches.

BRANDON

Standing. Leaning. Sitting. It’s 
all the same idea. Triangles are 
the strongest shape. This.

(he shows a wide stance)

Not this.

(a narrow one)

Okay, hand or hands on hips. Go.

Brandon claps and each boy/man lifts their hands to hips in 
their own manner. It’s a drill they’re being subjected to

35.

BRANDON (CONT’D)

(to what he sees)

Fingers forward not backwards 
S’just the way it is. Elbows out. 
Not back. S’just the way it is. 
Triangles. Triangles. 

Sykes watches with his hands on his hips. Not exactly the 
picture of manliness, he adjusts his own elbows out a little.

BRANDON (CONT’D)

Think of the shapes you are making 
and ask yourself... ‘Is this a 
manly shape I am making?’ Or, ‘is 
this a girly or a feminine shape?’

On Sarah frowning. She is sitting this one out. But she’ll 
serve another purpose.

BRANDON (CONT’D)

Sarah? I want you to arrange these 
guys in a line in terms of 
masculinity if you will. Least to 
most.

Jared and the others look around, wondering where they might 
fall on the line. Sarah tentatively starts in on the task.

BRANDON (CONT’D)

Myself, and other alcoholics and 
addicts put their faith in AA. Get 
familiar with this phrase -

(beat)

‘Fake it until you make it.’

Sarah struggles in deciding who is on what side of the MANLY 
evolutionary chain of L.I.A.

SYKES

Do it Sarah. Don’t think. Just do. 

Sykes’s authority seems diminished by the mere presence of 
Brandon, the clear biological ruler here.

Jared is moved along by Sarah. He is placed somewhere in the 
middle next to Gary. They share an awkward friendly nod. 
Sarah has placed Lee at one end and Jon and then Cameron at 
the ‘Most’ end. Cameron gets the crown.

Sarah stands back and Brandon steps forward. He walks the 
line starting with Lee... his face hides nothing in his 
confused assessment of Lee. As he completes the line -

36.

BRANDON
Perrrr-etty good.

Brandon moves to face Cameron, who stands at least five 
inches taller than him. He reads his ‘sticker’ name tag.

(beat)

BRANDON (CONT’D)

So. You think ‘Cameron’ here wins? 

You think being big and tall and 
overeating immediately just puts a 
guy at the front of the line?

Brandon lets it hang then moves away addressing the group. 
Cameron, relieved to have Brandon out of his personal space. 

BRANDON (CONT’D)

In prison I knew men who could shop 
at Gap for Kids, by that I mean 
little guys, who were pound for 
pound tougher than any linebacker. 
Swear to the mighty Lord.

(aside)

Now, Jesus was a tough dude. Don’t 
get me started on that.

He looks up at Cameron. Tries to make eye contact.

BRANDON (CONT’D)

It’s more than triangles and 
posture and genetics.

He offers to shake Cameron’s hand, to which Cameron offers a 
‘limp’ shake. Brandon casts it aside with disgust.

BRANDON (CONT’D)

Firm handshakes. Eye contact. Not 
too much. Looking at women at the 
right times. The wrong times too.

Meanwhile he pushes Cameron fourth down the line.

BRANDON (CONT’D)

No offense son. All a process. Fake 
it. Make it.

Jon now takes the prize of ‘manliest.’ Brandon offers a hand 
shake. Jon wants to... but he’s on his ‘no-touch’ promise. 
After a tense pause, he offers one of his salutes.

BRANDON (CONT’D)

Military man. G’bless son

EXT. BASEBALL BATTING CAGE - DAY

Jared and the others line up outside of a batting cage fence. 
We hear the ball being shot out and the grunt of -

Simon, who misses the ball, then miserably hits the second.

BRANDON

Who you are on the inside can be 
affected by the outside. Next.

Lee look bewildered, realizing it’s time to step up to the 
plate. Simon hands Lee the helmet.

BRANDON (CONT’D)

Outside in. Fake it till you make 
it. Adapt to survive.

Lee enters as Brandon slides another coin into the slot. 
There is a terrible anticipation and the first ball comes 
SHOOTING out. Lee startles.

BRANDON (CONT’D)

And you kids and folk, being what 
you are afflicted with -- 

Lee spins disoriented by the second. Then the third makes 
awful body contact, tilting the helmet from Lee. 

BRANDON (CONT’D)

- better learn how to survive.
Become the man you are not.

Jared sees Brandon smirk, amused, and unwilling to turn off 
the machine. Lee is swamped and scared. Gary goes in to help.

BRANDON (CONT’D)

When you are in a prison, you would  
surprise yourself --

On Jared absorbing all this as we hear -

METALLIC NOISES. GUNS in fact. Guns being loaded. CHK.CHK. 
Magazines being locked. CHK. Firing bolts being racked. 

EXT. FLAT BED TRUCK - DAY (FLASHBACK - 2002)

An array of HUNTING RIFLES placed on the flatbed tray. There 
are four in total, laying side by side.

BRANDON O.S.

The rifles are grabbed by their various owners.

EXT. FOREST - DAY (2002)

Big Jim, Marshall, Jared and a FOURTH MAN edge along a river, 
deeper into the woods. They split into two groups.

- Later, Jared following Marshall, pulls up to rest. Marshall
urges him on. A SHOT volleys out over the valley. Jared looks
back.

EXT. FOREST - DAY 

Jared helps Jim and his father winch a DEAD BUCK onto the 
back of one of Jim’s trucks

40.

.

INT. CARMEN’S STOP - AFTERNOON

Jared, dressed in his hunting gear, finishes off his fries as 
he sits alone. Marshall is at the counter with his glasses on 
paying the check and using easy charm with the WAITRESS.

Beside Jared’s table is A YOUNG MAN, barely 25, his three 
KIDS and young wife. There is also two men sitting at a 
window booth that Jared particularly notices. Just then - 

CHERYL, who works in the diner, comes up to the table. 

CHERYL

Hey Jared.

JARED
Oh. Cheryl. Hey.

CHERYL

Y’daddy’s pickin’ up everyone’s 
checks again. So sweet. He’s even 
paying for those two queers - 

JARED

You think they’re...?

CHERYL

They have to be. Actually quite 
nice though.

Marshall, now shaking hands with the OLD MAN, calls Jared 
over. He’s ready to leave. Jared passes the male couple, 
making eye contact with one of them. An awkward smile.

EXT./INT CARMEN’S STOP / MARSHALL’S TRUCK - DAY

Once in, Marshall takes a pile of religious pamphlets from 
the glove compartment. On one he writes a bible reference 
Romans 1:27.

MARSHALL

There are two men sitting by the 
window. I just paid for their 
lunch. Tell them I’d appreciate 
them taking a look at this paper 
and this verse. For their sake.

Jared wants to ask why, but is unable. He knows.

40A.

MARSHALL (CONT’D)

Men committed shameful acts with 
other men and received in 
themselves the due penalty for 
their error.

INT. CARMEN’S STOP - DAY

Jared walks back into the diner. He looks to where the men 
enjoy their lunch. Jared looks out the window to where his 
father’s truck is in clear view, watching. He moves in their 
direction holding the pamphlet behind his back.

JARED

You guys travelling?

MAN 1

We are on our way to a wedding in 
New Orleans.

JARED

Oh. Cool. Um... My father... my 
father just paid for your lunch.

The two men look strangely at this kid in hunting gear.

MAN 1

What’s the catch?

JARED

Nothing. Just... He’s out there -

The two men wave out the window. He pockets the flyer.

MAN 1

Well. Tell him thank you.

JARED

Yes Sir. Safe travels.

MAN 1

Thank you.

INT. MARSHALL’S TRUCK - LATER

Jared gets back into the truck. Marshall is staring at him. 
After a long silence --

MARSHALL
What did they say?

40B.

JARED

They said to say thank you.

The moment hangs. Does he know that Jared failed the task?

EXT. GRAVEL ROAD/L.I.A. COMPOUND - DAY

Feet hit gravel. Jared and the new group run in a somewhat 
military formation with Brandon as their commander. Aaron 
follows them driving the short bus.

INT. HAMPTON INN AND SUITES - DAY

Jared brushes his teeth - his shirt is off. He examines a 
bruise on the back of his shoulder: a baseball strike? But he 
enjoys the wound, like a new sense of his manhood.

Then - he catches himself with one hand on his hip. He clamps 
down on the tooth brush and stands ala Brandon: two hands on 
hip; hand back; legs wide - proudly faking it. Soon Nancy 
joins and they both brush side by side.

INT. L.I.A. MAIN AUDITORIUM - DAY

The words “Fake it till you Make it” written on the board. 
Then -  Sykes steps into frame, perusing -

The bewildered faces of the group staring back. 

SYKES O.S.

Now the real work starts. Catalogue 
your sins and ask God’s forgiveness 
for your wrongs. Sarah --

Sarah hesitates to get out of her chair. She finally does and 
passes Aaron who is setting a video camera on a tripod. His 
secondary task here seems to record significant events.

Sarah facing the group, reading from a handful of papers. She 
is mid-flow. It is painfully awkward hearing her read. She is 
trying to motor through it as fast as humanly possible.

sinful thoughts of other girls

SARAH (CONT'D)

. I would look at other girls in 
the changing rooms before gym. And 
in the showers. My biggest sin is 
one that I am also thankful for 
because it has led me to Love In 
Action. 

I had run away from my uncle’s 
house and stayed with some girls I 
knew whose parents were away. And 
it was there that for a few days I 
finally acted on my homosexual 
thoughts.

(beat)

(breathes)

I renounce these sinful thoughts 
and actions and I ask God to 
forgive me all these things -

Jared watches. He knows that he’ll be up there soon 
cataloging his own sins.

INT. L.I.A. MAIN AUDITORIUM - DAY

Sykes sets up the ‘LIE CHAIR’ exercise. Two empty chairs 
facing each other: a role-playing exercise.

Sarah takes one of the seats, waiting with dread.

SYKES O.S.

Go Sarah. There he is in that chair --

We smash right into the exercise. Jared watches Sarah be 
BERATED by Sykes to engage with an invisible family figure. 
Sarah grips the side of her chair. White knuckles.

CUT TO:

SYKES

- staring right back at you.

He isn’t. Opposite her is literally an empty chair.

Jared turns to check on Jon, who leans forward in his chair. 
Gary beside him, leans back biting his nails.

SYKES (CONT’D)

There he is. Use your words. Spit 
them out with purpose. Personal 
pronouns like I said. ‘YOU’ wronged 
me. ‘YOU’ showed me sin.

42.

SYKES (CONT’D)

But Sarah keeps thinking. Paralyzed. 

SYKES (CONT’D)

Don’t over think it. Nobody’s 
judging Sarah. But God is watching.

SARAH

I’m trying...

SYKES

He’s watching. And He’s waiting.

SARAH

I’m trying to find the right words.

Sykes unleashes a trial mock tirade on the empty chair.

SYKES

‘You wronged me. You wronged me 
Uncle...’ what was his name?

SARAH

Joe.

SYKES

‘You wronged me Uncle Joe -- You 
took me into the care of your home 
and locked me up for ---

It was two of them. Joe and Leila.

SARAH

SYKES

‘You wronged me Uncle Joe and Aunt -

(stops himself)

Aaron? Bring me that empty chair.

Aaron hustles and Sykes puts it next to the other empty 
chair. Two chairs for two imaginary people. Behind him we 
hear a laugh. He swivels, catching Tina with a smirk.

SYKES (CONT’D)

You think this is funny Tina? You 
think the reason y’all are here is 
funny? Take these exercises 
seriously. Do not waste my time. 
Each other’s time. God’s time. We 
are trying to help you.

He clicks his fingers in front of Sarah.

42A.

SYKES (CONT’D)

‘You wronged me Uncle Joe and Aunt 
Leila.’ Go!

(MORE)

SYKES (CONT’D)

43.

We wait for Sarah to GO... Instead she starts to tear-up.

SYKES (CONT’D)

Yes. Yes. Let it out.

SARAH

Leila wasn’t my aunt. She was my 
cousin that lived with Uncle Joe.

SYKES

(sighs)

Alright. Let’s take a break.

He checks his watch. Aaron turns off the camera.

SYKES (CONT’D)

Sarah can try again tomorrow. Every 
day, two of you will walk into the 
arc like Noah’s animals. And get 
refuge from damnation. This is the 
ticket of entry. No free rides.

He taps the empty chair and meets with Michael who has an 
urgent issue. Sykes turns, concerned.

INT. L.I.A. MAIN AUDITORIUM - DAY

It’s tea break, Jared walks over to a shaken Sarah.

JARED

You want anything? I’m making a cup 
of tea.

She shakes her head, and as he walks away she stops him -

SARAH

You’re at the Hampton right? I seen 
you there.

(off his look)

Seven o’clock can you meet me by 
the ATM in the dining area. Bring 
your phone. Please.

Jared nods and moves away, conflicted by the encounter.

Through the open door Jared sees Sykes with two PARENTS. It’s 
somewhat heated: admonishment by the father. Then we see Lee, 
backpack on. The father turns on Sykes --

44.

LEE’S DAD O.S.

We told you that!! Unacceptable.

As Sykes moves back toward the door, everyone disperses.

INT. HAMPTON INN AND SUITES RESTAURANT - NIGHT (PRESENT) 
Jared and Nancy eat dinner, Jared scarfing down food while 
doing his L.I.A. homework and referring to the HANDBOOK.

Headphones on, he flicks through his Moleskin with the ripped 
out pages. We see his notes --

Moral Inventory and... Without going into ‘graphic detail,’ 
catalogue all immoral and sexual experiences  & He adds... 
‘How you came to be at L.I.A.?’ 

He checks his watch. Almost seven --

INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

Jared walks into the hallway leading to the bathrooms. It is 
empty apart from the ATM. Then the bathroom door opens up and 
Sarah peeks through. Seeing Jared she marches over covertly 
and puts her hand out. He hands her his phone and just as 
quickly she disappears into the bathroom. He waits. 
Awkwardly. That’s when he sees -

Sykes, with a woman and kids, ages six and four. They move 
into the restaurant. Seemingly, an average American family.

Jared nervously hides behind the ATM and waits guiltily. What 
is he doing? What if he gets caught?

Finally Sarah emerges wiping her eyes. She hands Jared the 
phone and utters -

SARAH

Don’t you dare tell anyone.

Jared watches her sneak away like she was never even there.

INT. HAMPTON INN AND SUITES DINING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Jared gathers his things, aware of Sykes’s presence.

I’ll finish this in my room. You 
ready?

And Jared is gone. Nancy follows but looks around wondering: 
‘Why is that a bad thing?’

Sykes, hearing clatter, looks up. Did he see Jared?

INT. HAMPTON INN AND SUITES - NIGHT

In the room, Jared sits on his bed. We push in on him, 
knowing what his homework is. 

The building intro of - The Red Hot Chili Peppers - ‘Can’t 
Stop.’

We see Jared’s pen move over a fresh page. He writes ‘HENRY.’ 

HENRY O.S.

Yo. I got you pal.

INT. STAIRWELL, LYON COLLEGE - DAY (FLASHBACK, FALL 2003) 55

Music, emanating from a nearby room continues over --

Jared is struggling up some stairs with two full drawers. 
Things have started to fall and topple when a fit and tanned 
guy, Henry, bounds up the stairs toward him. Perfect timing.

HENRY

Here. I can take the top stuff.

Jared accepts the help with an awkward thanks. Henry looks in 
a drawer as he carries it. It is mainly full of books.

HENRY (CONT’D)

Which room? Just learned a bunch of 
things about you in half a second 
looking in this drawer by the way.

JARED

Oh yeah? I’m in three-four-six.

HENRY

I’m in two-three-seven. You run? 
People who run know about Asics.

There are Asics on Jared’s feet. 

HENRY (CONT’D)

I saw you unloading from that car 
with the Razorbacks sticker. You 
from Arkansas? I’m there a lot

INT. JARED’S DORM ROOM 346 - MOMENTS LATER

The room has a double bunk beds. There is no one else there.

HENRY

First one in gets to choose. You 
got a girl? If so you might wanna 
apply for a room without bunks. 

JARED
Just broke up. 

HENRY

(winks)

Good timing. Before college. 

They head for the door.

HENRY O.S.

I got cousins in Mountain Home.

EXT. LYON COLLEGE, ARKANSAS - DUSK  
Jared and Henry go for a run. We are behind them. 
--------------------------------------------------------------
TITLE CARD:  HENRY 
--------------------------------------------------------------

Jared and Henry at one end of the run, sweat heavily and gasp 
for air. They occasionally look at each other.

HENRY

We’re a good fit. Hate running with 
slow pokes. Or speed freaks.

(beat)

Tell you what. Race you on the way 
back. Last one back has to go to 
the other one’s church. Serious.

JARED

Why? What kind of church is it?

HENRY
You game or not?

Jared smiles goofily

HENRY (CONT’D)

Ready? After three. One, two, 
Three, GO!

47.

CUT TO:

INT. THE HEALING HANDS PENTACOSTAL CHURCH - DAY

The opening POWER CHORDS of a Christian Rock band’s opener.

Jared and Henry sit among many YOUNG PEOPLE who throw their 
hands in the air, CHEERING. A Pentecostal Church meeting in 
full swing. More a party than a service.

LEAD SINGER

Get on your feet for Jesus.

Everyone stands and Henry does too. Jared is a beat behind 
like a guilty outside observer. His dad would HATE this kind 
of worship. Henry offers Jared a hand to stand.  Jared stands 
and watches as Henry, euphoric, cuffs the young TEEN in front 
of him and lets out a ‘whoop.’

HENRY

(beaming)

Radical huh?

The minister, the YOUNG charismatic FRANK, 35, on the stage -

FRANK

Let’s sing it for Jesus --

HENRY/EVERYONE

Amen/Amen!

Henry puts his manly arm around Jared who allows himself to 
smile and start to enjoy it. He relaxes and puts his arm 
around Henry too. It’s a brotherly embrace that feels safe in 
this environment. But --

The music turns to something synthesized and ominous.

EXT. LYON COLLEGE CAMPUS - NIGHT

Jared and Henry on a run, jog around trees, deflecting cherry 
blossom tree branches to cut a smoother line.

Later -

At the end of their run, they stare at each other as they 
stretch and search for oxygen. Jared tries a smile. But it’s 
a little long and Henry frowns, a tad suspicious

47A.

48.

INT. JARED’S DORM ROOM 346 - LATER

That ominous music is a SYNTHETIC LOOP from TOM CLANCY’S 
SPLINTER CELL. 

Jared and Henry are still dressed in sweats. We see from 
behind as Jared controls the game and Henry watches, sipping 
a beer. A lone player makes his way through the green and 
blue glow of an underground concrete facility.  Jared steals 
a look at Henry’s face, glowing in the screen’s light.

Henry checks his watch. Sips his beer. He’s tired.

HENRY

Y’said your roommate’s not coming 
back till tomorrow?

JARED

On some golf trip. You wanna crash?

Jared moves to turn off the game.

HENRY

You keep playing.

Henry gets up and we hear the sounds of Henry climbing up the 
bunk ladder.

Jared watches, turns down the sound and then goes back to his 
game, conflicted. He’s attracted it’s clear. But Henry is 
straight and Jared has ZERO experience with ANYONE.

JARED O.S.

Am I in trouble?

INT. L.I.A. ADMIN OFFICE - DAY (PRESENT)

Tight on Jared’s face as a door opens and shuts O.S.

JARED

Have I done something wrong?

MICHAEL O.S.

Here he comes now.

SYKES O.S.

Morning Jared.

Sykes sits carrying a file. His demeanor is supremely casual 
and friendly. Not the ‘man on show’ he is in the group 
sessions. The only sound is a ticking clock

48A.

49.

SYKES

No reason to be worried. Around day 
three I just check in with the new 
recruits. See how they’re getting 
along. Little private chat.

A poster behind Sykes linking AIDS to homosexual deviant 
behavior draws Jared’s attention for a moment.

SYKES (CONT’D)

So, how is it going for ya?

JARED

It’s good. I’m finding it all... 
helpful, yeah.

SYKES

How is your Moral Inventory coming 
along? Are you ready? You wanna go 
today? Dive right in?

JARED

Oh... I, um.. I’d like to watch a 
couple more people do theirs I 
think, if that’s okay. I haven’t 
completed everything yet.

Sykes pulls out a handful of papers from his file: Jared’s 
journal stories. He selects a page and holds it up.

SYKES

What is this?

JARED

It’s a story.

SYKES

It’s a love story about a boy and a 
girl. Were you thinking about two 
boys when you wrote this?

(hold)

Is this a true story?

JARED

No. It’s just a story.

(off Sykes)

Will I be able to get them back? 
They’re assignments for college.

49A.

SYKES

Yes, I noticed your list of books 
here. A reading list I assume.

(holds it up
(MORE)

50.

SYKES (CONT'D)

Some of these books -- considering 
everything that’s going on for you, 
I wonder if this is really the 
right thing for you to be pursuing 
at all. Perhaps a year with us is a 
better use of your time. Something 
to think about.

This troubles Jared, but he nods. Sykes reads him, his eyes 
narrowing a little and then the smile returns - 

SYKES (CONT’D)

Listen. I want you to know, I’ve 
had conversations with your parents 
in the lead up to you being here, 
and I know a little of your story 
somewhat.

(smiles)

I know there are discrepancies from 
what your parents were told and 
what you have said to them. And 
they are really unsure what to 
believe. But, I know there is a 
bigger story. Or stories. Right? 
We’re not here based on mere 
thoughts alone.

(beat)

You know, the ones that get the 
most out of this, are the ones who 
are brave. The ones who fess up to 
what God already sees, Jared.

His friendly concern has somehow taken on the air of threat.

SYKES (CONT’D)

You really gotta put it all on the 
table here. That way we can really 
assess what is the best future for 
you.

INT/EXT. HALLWAY/SYKES’S OFFICE - DAY

SLOW MOTION: Jared walks out. We read his disappointment -

GARY O.S.

Dear heavenly father, today I ask 
your forgiveness for my sins. 

Jared takes the corner

51.

GARY O.S. (CONT’D)

For a year we lived under the cover 
of being ‘roommates’ though we 
weren’t using separate rooms. 

INT. L.I.A. MAIN AUDITORIUM - DAY

Gary goes through the process of reading his Moral Inventory. 
He has tears streaming his face. To the side - Aaron is 
filming with his small mounted camera.

GARY

Much like a normal couple we lived 
that way and for a time... it felt 
normal... Until my family 
discovered the truth. But I was 
fooling myself. Being fooled. I was 
seduced into sin... by all sorts of 
sinful people... I knew in my heart 
I had forsaken Jesus for Satan.

Jared listens, frowns. This just seems like a regular, caring 
relationship being described. He looks across to Jon who we 
can see has a minor black eye. Jon won’t engage.

GARY (CONT’D)

But I am awake to my sins. I can’t 
believe the disgusting person that 
I once was. I ask --

The haunting SYNTHETIC music of ‘SPLINTER CELL’ Pulses --

SYKES O.S.

Lesbian. Gay. Bi --

INT. L.I.A. AUDITORIUM - DAY

On the board is a circle with several WORDS inside of it: 
Marriage, Children, family, support, caring.  In an opposing 
circle is another list: Rape, child molestation, promiscuity, 
AIDS , loneliness, zero children -- 

Sykes writes Heterosexual over the ‘Good/LIFE’ circle, and 
‘Homosexual’ and LGBTQ over the other. He adds ‘D’ and ‘P’ as 
well, literally as a joke.

51A.

SYKES

Transgender, Queer... Dolphins... 
Pandas, Unicorns. Cupcakes. So much 
choice over here
(MORE)

SYKES (CONT'D)

52.

It’s designed to make everyone laugh, and most don’t but 
Jared and Jon do. Sykes adds ‘DEATH’ above the circle.

SYKES (CONT’D)

Talk about one way to ruin your 
dollar bill. To burn it by falling 
right back into hell. Inviting this 
behavior into your life --

Move in on Jared as the ‘SPLINTER CELL’ theme riffs. We will 
recognize it and it will take us back to -

INT. JARED’S DORM ROOM 346 - NIGHT (FLASHBACK) 
We are taken back to the night Henry crashes in Jared’s dorm.

Jared plays alone for a beat but then finishes a game and 
turns the console off, casting the room into darkness.

Later - Jared is lying on his bunk, still awake. Noises come 
from the springs above: Henry moving. Turning. After a while -
-

Can’t sleep, huh?

(no answer)

JARED

Probably shouldn’t run so late at 
night.

Then the figure of Henry jumps down in the darkness. A weird 
moment of pause as Jared turns to look at his silhouette. 

HENRY

Um...

Jared frowns. Something in the air. Then -

Suddenly, Henry lunges forward and clamps a hand over Jared’s 
mouth. Almost gently the command comes - 

HENRY (CONT’D)

Shhhh. Shut up.

In a weird and almost silent flurry, Jared is forced to flip 
over by Henry. His sweats are pulled down and Henry is on 
him.

During the rapid and silent rape Jared’s head is knocked 
against the upright strut arm of the bunk. Then it is over. 
Henry recedes. And all we hear is -

Damn it.

HENRY O.S.

(MORE)

52A.

HENRY O.S. (CONT'D)

53.

Hold on Jared. Paralyzed. His forehead trickles blood.

-- We hear Henry climb back up on the top bunk.

Jared is confused. What the hell just happened? We hold on 
this for the longest time. Until -

Henry starts to cry. Finally, Jared moves ever so slightly.

HENRY O.S. (CONT’D)

What is wrong with me? What the 
hell is wrong with me?

Jared rolls over onto his back. He listens to Henry cry.

HENRY O.S. (CONT’D)

I’m going to be in so much trouble.

JARED

Are you okay?

Oh man. 

HENRY

JARED

Henry?

(beat)

Have you done that before?

Silence. Long.

HENRY

I need to confess. I’m going to 
have to... will you hear me? Can 
you keep this between us?

Jared thinks and utters ‘Mmhmm.’ And Henry jumps down. He 
sits on Jared’s bed. Jared doesn’t move.

HENRY (CONT’D)

I’m so sorry. 

Hold.

HENRY (CONT’D)

Remember that kid from church. The 
one in front of us..?

INT. JARED’S DORM ROOM 346 - MORNING

Jared wakes. Cautiously he stands to see - 

54.

Henry has gone. The bunk is neatly made, and there’s a note - 
when Jared unfolds it, it merely says -  “Run @ 6?”

The door opens, startling him: The ROOMMATE, carrying golf 
clubs, back from his trip. They exchange ‘hellos’.

INT. LYON COLLEGE, AUDITORIUM - DAY  
Jared sits in a class as it is filling up. We push in on him.  

Later - he sits alone in the now empty space.

Later - he sits outside against a wall, alone.

EXT. TRACK, LYON COLLEGE - DUSK

Henry limbers up. Stretches for his run. He looks around for 
Jared: a no-show. He begins texting. Then -

JARED O.S.

Hey. Sorry.

HENRY

Thought you weren’t coming.

JARED

I nearly had to head home. 

Henry - curious. Jared starts to stretch.

JARED (CONT’D)

It’s all good. My aunt’s a bit 
sick. I’ll probably head back in 
the morning for a couple days.

HENRY

Let’s stretch and pray.

(off his expression)

Why not? For your Aunt.

Henry takes a knee, but it doubles as a quad stretch. 

HENRY (CONT’D)

Dear Heavenly Father..

Jared and Henry run at a medium jog. We follow behind.

HENRY V/O 

We pray that you remove all 
obstacles from our path. 

They take a bend.

HENRY V/O (CONT’D)

And we give thanks for our freedom, 
for our youth, and our health, 
whereas others are less fortunate. 

We continue to lead them now as Henry looks across to Jared. 
It is clear he is concerned for Jared’s withdrawal.

HENRY V/O (CONT’D)

We pray for Jared’s aunt, that she 
may be restored to health and we 
dedicate this run to her recovery.

INT. JARED’S FORD MUSTANG - DAY

Jared drives his car. We are behind him.

HENRY V/O

We run guided by your love and  
lifted by your spirit. Each step a 
prayer that all of your children 
share the same abundance. 

The pair move down a rise and disappear into darkness.

INT. LYON COLLEGE, HALLWAY - DAY

Henry moves with a purpose. A swagger. We follow as he raises 
a flip cell phone to his ear.

HENRY/JARED V/O

Amen. Amen.

Jared gets out of his car and moves to the house where he is 
greeted with great warmth by his mother

Jared dumps his bag as he moves through the house. 

HENRY O.S.

I’m looking to get a hold of him.

INT. LYON COLLEGE, HALLWAY - DAY

Henry walks the hall dialing a new number. 

INT. JARED’S BEDROOM - DAY

Jared takes his sneakers off and turns on his computer.  The 
faint O.S. sounds of a phone ringing.

INT. EAMONS FAMILY KITCHEN - DAY

The phone rings in the kitchen. We follow Nancy as she wipes 
her hands and moves to answer.

NANCY

Hello?

INT./EXT. HALLWAY / LYON COLLEGE COURTYARD - DAY

Henry opens the wide doors to the college courtyard where 
hundreds of kids enjoy the sun.

We hear Henry’s mumbled voice on the other end of the line. 

We move in on Nancy’s ‘not so great’ portrait of the family, 
now hanging on the wall.

NANCY (CONT’D)

Yes? What about him?

INT. EAMONS FAMILY HOME/JARED’S ROOM - AFTERNOON

Jared sits on his bed reading. A knock comes to the door.

MARSHALL O.S.

Jared?

Something in the tone of his voice makes Jared concerned.

INT. EAMONS FAMILY LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

We SMASH INTO A FIERCE FAMILY ARGUMENT. Jared IS AT WAR with 
his father. Under interrogation. Nancy is the bystander.

Did he give you a name?

JARED

Answer my question?!

MARSHALL

JARED

If he gave you a name... I’m just 
saying, why wouldn’t he give you -

MARSHALL

Answer me. Are you doing all the 
things he says?

JARED

Did he give you his name?

MARSHALL

Enough. I command you -

JARED

- command me all you want. I’m
asking questions too.

Marshall makes a move toward Jared.

NANCY

He didn’t give me his name.

(wavers)

I don’t think.

They both look to Nancy

57A.

58.

JARED

The guy is full of shit!

MARSHALL

Nancy. Leave the room.

JARED

I’ll leave the room.

MARSHALL

No. You sit down.

JARED

It’s bullshit, dad.

MARSHALL

NANCY

He just said ‘counselor’. I 
asked for his name --

MARSHALL (CONT'D)

(a warning)

-- Nancy.

NANCY

--- and a number but...

See.

JARED

NANCY!

MARSHALL

Nancy starts to retreat. Finally she leaves.

JARED

I can’t believe this.

Marshall tries a new tactic, trying to focus the conversation.

MARSHALL

Okay son... Let’s sit and talk 
calmly. Man to man.

JARED

No. Dad, because it’s --

MARSHALL

-- Is it true? He said you’ve 
been... that you are a homosexual. 

Jared sighs deeply. He gets up and moves for the door.

MARSHALL (CONT’D)

Hey. We are not finished.

I am. Because you won’t listen

JARED

58A.

JARED (CONT'D)

59.

Jared tries to go to his room. Marshall tries to intercept 
him. Nancy watches from the hallway.

Jared tries to force the door shut which results in a 
physical battle now with his father. The door hits Marshall’s 
face, knocking him backwards and bringing renewed fury.

Marshall forces Jared against the wall.

MARSHALL

Answer me! What this man 
says...

MARSHALL

Is it true?

JARED (CONT'D)

(correcting)

- What this full-of-shit guy
who is not a counselor and -

JARED

Who didn’t have the spine to 
give his own name -

Son!!

MARSHALL (CONT'D)

JARED

Who raped a kid at his Pentacostal 
church group. And... God knows who 
else.

Marshall, still grips his son, but is rattled into stillness.

JARED (CONT’D)

Dad, you’re hurting me.

Questions rage in his father’s grip. But the thought of 
hurting his son wakes him from the attack.

JARED (CONT’D)

Dad. It’s not true. The guy is 
lying. I can tell you --

As Marshall slowly releases, Jared steps forward. He takes in 
his mother and father flanking him.

JARED (CONT’D)

His name is Henry Wallace. He’s not 
a counselor. He’s a student too. He 
told me he did some bad things.

(beat)

I think he thinks I’m going to tell 
on him. 

Pause. The dust settles finally. But, Marshall’s radar is 
tuned to the fact that he doesn’t have ALL the information

60.

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

Jared is playing a game on his PLAYSTATION 2: FINAL DOOM - 
Level 9 with its dread filled pipe-organ theme track. Roaming 
the pit, he blasts demon soldiers and fiery skulls with a 
double barrel shotgun. Computer blood flows freely. He is 
deep in burying his reality when his father walks in. 

MARSHALL

Your mother is making dinner.

JARED

I’m okay. I’m not hungry.

He pauses the game as Marshall sets down a note pad and pen.

MARSHALL

I want you to write down this boy’s 
name and the name of this 
Pentecostal Church. If he did what 
you say then it needs to be 
reported.

JARED

I don’t want you to talk to him.

MARSHALL

I think this matter is a little too 
important for us to get into the 
business of protecting anyone.

Jared looks at the paper and pen. Marshall moves to leave.

MARSHALL (CONT’D)

Eric is coming over tomorrow to 
discuss rewiring for the new 
ministry.

I extended the invitation to Chloe 
and Brandy too. I’d appreciate it 
if you stuck around another -

If you can miss one day of classes, 
I’m sure one more is not going to 
end the world.

MARSHALL (CONT'D)

Why did you come back in the first 
place? Mid-week?

The way he asks it still feels like he mistrusts his son

MARSHALL (CONT’D)

You know there is nothing like the 
feeling of... being with a woman. 
If you knew what it was like -

JARED

Dad. It’s not true.

Jared goes to put his head phones on.

MARSHALL

You know what I think about those 
kind of games too. 

Marshall leaves. Distracted, Jared is swamped by soldiers. 
Game Over. He sits in silence for a moment and then -

Jared explodes. The closest thing we have seen to rage. He 
rips the cord from the controller out of the system and 
throws it across the room. 

INT. EAMONS FAMILY KITCHEN - NIGHT 

Marshall looks at his ministry architectural plans while 
Nancy preps dinner. A somber mood. Broken as - 

Jared enters and drops the ENTIRE gaming system on the table, 
cords and all. BAM.

JARED

You want me to stop with the games?

His parents are puzzled.

JARED (CONT’D)

Ok... I’ll stop with them.

Pause.

JARED (CONT’D)

I don’t want to see Chloe.

(beat)

We broke up.

And he exits, leaving his parents confused. But then - 
Moments later he is back ---

JARED (CONT’D)

We broke up because... I think I’m. 
In fact, I’m pretty sure that I’m -

Jared is trying to find the words. It’s hard, but he’s going 
to stay until the message gets across. Finally 

61A.

62.

-

Marshall swoops up his architect plans, and leaves the room. 
There is a long pause. Until Nancy awkwardly pipes up.

NANCY

Are you sure honey?

INT. JARED’S ROOM - FAMILY HOME - NIGHT

Jared is watching through a crack in the door. He sees -

In the kitchen his father sitting, embracing his mother. Then  
he hears a car and moves to the window. He is alarmed to see -

Two men approach the house: Big Jim and Pastor Wilkes. 
Marshall walks to greet them. It’s definitely conspiratorial. 
And it’s definitely something to do with Jared. He moves to 
the landing to watch them enter the house, careful to avoid 
being seen.

MARSHALL

Thanks for coming Jim. Pastor. 

INT. L.I.A. OFFICE - AFTERNOON (PRESENT)

The daily pick-up. Jared goes to collect his cell phone as 
Jon is leaving the pick-up area, already having taken his. We 
see that bruised eye more closely. Jon nods goodbye.

EXT. HAMPTON INN AND SUITES PARKING LOT - AFTERNOON

Jared and Nancy in profile shuffle back after a long day. 
Jared’s eye catches something and he stops briefly. 

The BEST WESTERN sign. He and Jon are neighbors. 

INT. HAMPTON INN AND SUITES ROOM - NIGHT

Jared stands at the window staring at the blue and yellow lit 
tower of the BEST WESTERN: Jon’s temporary home.

NANCY O.S.

We are trying a new place. 

EXT. HAMPTON INN AND SUITES, PARKING LOT - MORNING

We follow Jared and Nancy toward the BEST WESTERN. Nancy, 
always dressed like it’s dinner, even when it’s breakfast.

63.

NANCY O.S.

- in search of the perfect soft-
boiled egg.

INT. THE BEST WESTERN, BUFFET ROOM - MORNING

Nancy holds a bedazzled phone in overly manicured hands. 
Bangles rattle and rings knock against bigger rings. 
Meanwhile, Jared scans the room, looking for Jon.

NANCY

We’re about to find out.

As Jared cracks the top off a soft-boiled egg, Nancy 
stretches out those hands in suspenseful expectation: The 
pantomime of ‘Did they get it right?’ One of their many 
‘games.’ Off Jared’s reaction, she clenches her fists: 
‘foiled again.’ 

Overcooked.

(into the phone)

NANCY (CONT’D)

If they have an office in Memphis, 
I could check the color swatches 
down here. I think a muted green is 
a good match with oak. Blue is 
always a little dominant, 
regardless of shade.

Jared goes back to scanning the room. Then he finds -

Jon. Trailed by a guy (20s). An older brother Jared guesses: 
an even manlier version of Jon. The brother hangs back to 
talk on his cell, as Jon hits the buffet.

INT. THE BEST WESTERN - MORNING

Jared plants himself at the buffet waiting to be seen.

JON

Plate?

Jared almost answers but then realizes it’s not an offering 
for him. Instead - Jon’s brother brushes past.

BROTHER

I said I’ll look after myself.

JON

You want a juice? 

And so it comes to be that Jon COMPLETELY IGNORES JARED

63A.

64.

BROTHER

Look after yourself. I got mine.

Jared hangs, self-consciously filling his plate, until it’s 
safe to walk back to the table.

INT. THE BEST WESTERN, BUFFET ROOM - MORNING

Jared sits back down at the table, stung. He is handed the 
phone by Nancy.

JARED

Hey Dad. How’s the remodeling 
going?

He looks across one last time for Jon. No luck.

JARED (CONT’D)

I’m sorry I’m not there to help. 

(beat)

I said it’s fun.

(listens)

Huh? Oh yeah. Good. It’s fun. 

PRE-LAP: the SOUNDS OF A GROWN MAN WEEPING. DEEP PAIN.

INT. L.I.A MAIN AUDITORIUM - DAY

Tight on Aaron’s video camera. Its red light on. Recording. 

Phillip sits crying while Aaron films him.

The faces of Jared and others as they react to the LIE CHAIR 
exercise and catharsis. Cameron bites his nails.

PHILLIP

(in between sobs)

I hate you. I hate you. I --

Phillip gives his last bit of energy and SOBS now, 
uncontrollably. Broken. Sykes tentatively helps him up.

SYKES

Good job Phillip. We love you.

EVERYONE

We love you Phillip.

64A.

See. Good job. Go wash up if you 
need. Michael -

SYKES

(MORE)

SYKES (CONT'D)

65.

Michael steps forward to escort him. They walk out together 
with Aaron.

Jared looks across at Jon, who won’t make eye contact with 
him. He looks pissed. He then sees an empty chair. He looks 
around. Jared turns to look around. Sarah is missing.

INT. L.I.A. MAIN AUDITORIUM - DAY

Jon is grabbing a boxed lunch. Jared come up beside him. 

JARED

No one knows where Sarah is.
Have you heard anything?

He eyeballs Jared briefly. Jared feels scolded. 

JON

Is this all a game to you? What 
were you doing over there anyway? 

JARED

We got sick of the breakfast at our 
place. 

JON

(moving off)

Okay. You tell yourself that.

MOMENTS LATER, Jared sits drinking tea on his own.

JON O.S.

Listen, man -

Jon plants himself in another chair.

JON

You gotta think about why you went 
there. Seriously. You don’t think I 
wasn’t fishing for where you were 
staying when I told you my hotel. 
These are the urges we gotta stamp 
out. Whole reason we’re even here. 
Gotta control this.

He taps his head too hard. Admonishing.

We were just looking for somewhere 
that could do boiled eggs properly. 
Seriously.

JARED

(MORE)

66.

JARED (CONT'D)

JON

True ownership man. That’s what 
Moral Inventory’s about. Owning 
your shit. If you want a boiled egg 
then tell your place how long you 
want them cooked. They got a 
kitchen and eggs and a chef. Don’t 
come to my place pretending. Or 
else you gotta add it to your M.I.

Jon gives a ‘sure you were’ grunt then jumps up seeing 
Cameron is throwing a football inside with Tina. He joins. We 
sees Cameron, suddenly relaxed and happy to have a football 
in his hands. 

Jared stands too... beside Jon. They take turns throwing back 
to Cameron who is now joined by Tina. The group keep 
throwing, but suddenly STOP when they hear the door open.

SYKES

You don’t have to stop. 

In the B.G., Sykes starts re-arranging chairs with Michael.

SYKES O.S.

Football is okay. S’long as you 
don’t break anything. In fact --

Sykes jumps in and starts throwing with them. It becomes 
awkward but sort of fun. The whole group encouraged to join 
in. Some do. Some don’t. Jared watches the madness. Then --

SYKES

Cameron!!

He throws the ball to Cameron, who catches it happily as --

SYKES O.S

You’re up. Moral Inventory and Lie 
Chair.

And the carefree smile turns to paralyzing fear.

INT. L.I.A. MAIN AUDITORIUM - DAY

Cameron is in the chair now. He is doing the Lie Chair 
exercise. Cameron reads from a piece of paper --

CAMERON

You wronged me dad and I hate you --

It’s so quiet that everyone has to lean in to hear him. 
Aaron, behind the camera, gestures to Sykes: ‘volume’

66A.

67.

SYKES

We can’t hear you Cameron!

CAMERON

- hate you for the way you have
treated me since you found out
about my problems.

SYKES

‘About my sins.’ Say it Cameron. 

Cameron looks like he wants to disappear. Jared intervenes.

JARED

I can go. I don’t mind -

SYKES

(shutting him down)

Everyone gets a turn. This is 
Cameron’s turn. Cameron? ‘Found out 
about my sins’ --

CAMERON

Found out about my sins.

SYKES

Louder. 

CAMERON

(trying, still soft)

-- I hate you because you never 
listen to me, or acknowledge me. Or 
if you do acknowledge me it’s to 
make fun of me --

SYKES

‘IT’S TO MAKE FUN OF ME!!’

CAMERON

-- in front of other people, or -
You just yell at me --

Sykes decides to let Cameron work at his own volume.

CAMERON (CONT’D)

When you told me you wished I 
hadn’t been born, that really hurt.

Cameron stops reading from his notes. He looks at Sykes.

67A.

Well, you say that you are angry, 
but frankly I don’t see it. ‘That 
really hurt.

SYKES

(MORE)

68.

SYKES (CONT'D)

(nothing from Cameron)
I wanna see you express it.

Cameron sighs. Something is definitely inside of him -

SYKES (CONT’D)

Only then can we have a chance to 
tell these people in the real world 
how they have affected us.

Cameron’s wraps his arms around himself.

SYKES (CONT’D)

Where is that anger Cameron? You 
wanna learn and grow? Well?

(turns away)

I guess not. Oh, well.

(to the group)

S’up to you.

Sykes urges the others to go on break and they all file 
around Cameron who sits, feeling a failure in the chair -

But then - they hear an almighty noise and turn to see -

- Cameron bring the chair crashing down like a pick-axe, on 
the empty chair opposite, POUNDING it repeatedly. Everyone is 
in shock. When the dust settles, they all stare at Cameron, 
and Cameron back at them --

Um. Sorry.

CAMERON

Cameron looks around like he has made a mistake. He retreats 
into apologies, and starts to pick up what he’s broken. 

SYKES

It’s okay. It’s okay. Take a break 
Cameron. I’ll get that.

CAMERON

I’m sorry. That’s just how I 
express my anger so --

SYKES

That’s on me. It’s okay. Good job. 
We love you Cameron.

GROUP

We love you Cameron.

Cameron passes by, watched by Brandon and applauded by Jon.

Jared watches Cameron retreat back into his massive shell

68A.

69.

INT. L.I.A. BATHROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

Jared steps up to pee. Unbuttoning, he sees a shape pass the 
high window. Curious, he hoists himself up, and can see -

Sykes, alone and in the magical afternoon light staring at 
the tree line. Hands on his hips. Jared immediately wonders 
about him. Then the door swings open and Jared steps down -

BRANDON O.S.

You’re meant to attend bathroom 
breaks with a staff member.

Brandon eyes him cautiously, and Jared goes to exit --

BRANDON

What, you not gonna pee now?

Jared realizes his mistake. Looks at his unbuttoned pants.

BRANDON (CONT’D)

Or were you gonna do something 
solo? That’s why they make the 
rules.

Jared turns back to pee. It’s a fearful stop-start pee.

BRANDON (CONT’D)

Sounds like Morse code. You sending 
me a message, faggot? 

Finished, Jared goes to walk out. Brandon turns on the tap to 
for him to wash. He complies. Now Brandon gets awful close 
and hands him a paper towel. 

BRANDON (CONT’D)

I do not get you guys at all. Too 
much mothering and not enough 
fathering. I can’t be both for you.

Finally Jared is allowed to leave.

INT. NANCY’S CAR - DAY 

Jared rides back from L.I.A. deep in his head. Nancy drives 
wondering if she should respect the silence or probe --

It’s still early. Do you want to 
watch a movie

NANCY

(MORE)

70.

NANCY (CONT'D)

JARED

I got homework still. Plus,
I can’t anyway. The rules say all 
movies contain ‘sinful content.’

NANCY

What about an animation?

JARED

‘What’d you do last night?’ ‘I was 
hanging at the Hampton Inn watching 
The Lion King with my mom.’

Jared winds his window down. Nancy turns off the air -

NANCY

You want fresh air?

Jared reaches out his hand and his hand dances with the air.

NANCY (CONT’D)

Honey... You know I don’t like -

JARED

Mom! Who did that happen to and 
when? Seriously!? Do you know!?

Nancy retreats into silence. But Jared is spoiling for a 
fight.

JARED (CONT’D)

Seriously. Do you actually know who 
that happened to? Do you? For real?

After another silence -

JARED (CONT’D)

It was Nobody. From Nowhere Town. 

(beat)

On Highway Zero. It never happened.

Now she feels the right to bite back.

NANCY

Parents want to protect their kids.

JARED

So they feed them lies.

NANCY

I think those are okay lies.

Jared, realizing he’s been unfairly combative, pulls his hand 
back just a little bit

70A.

71.

JARED

You know the whole thing you and 
Dad are paying for here is all 
about how messed up we are by our 
parents. They want to know about 
you. That’s why you can’t know all 
about it. Cause then they wouldn’t 
get their money out of you.

NANCY

What have I ever done to you? I’m 
not a drunk or a divorcee. Your 
father and I don’t fight. We barely 
even raise our voices.

(beat)

Talk about me however you want, my 
conscience is clean.

Nancy stops. She hit ‘my’ a little too hard. Silence.

NANCY (CONT’D)

I think I should read the book too.

(beat)

See what it’s all about. Read these 
rules and what not.

(no answer)

They get to discuss us. I think we 
should know about them too. We are 
paying for it, and trusting them 
with your care.

Jared winds his window up: Happy? He leans against the glass.

INT. HAMPTON INN AND SUITES - NIGHT

Jared and his mother schlep down the hallway. Five steps 
behind his mother Jared’s step is heavy and tired.

INT. HAMPTON INN AND SUITES - ROOM - NIGHT

Jared sits on his bed as his mother showers in the bathroom -

Jared flips open his phone and finds the number Sarah dialed 
two days before. He presses dial after a moment of 
deliberation. Waits... Then -

YOUNG FEMALE VOICE

Hello? Sarah? 

(beat)

Sarah is that you??

Jared hangs up. Soon he turns to find Nancy there 

71A.

72.

NANCY

Honey. Is everything okay?

He nods. She holds up the handbook. That’s when he notices 
she has taken it from the nightstand.

NANCY (CONT’D)

I’m reading it. No debate. I need 
to know what’s inside of it.

JARED

I don’t see why anyone would read 
it unless you absolutely had to.

INT. HAMPTON INN AND SUITES - NANCY’S ROOM

We push slowly toward Nancy’s room as -

JARED O.S.

You can read it at night when I’m 
here if you seriously want to.

(beat)

There are tons of spelling errors 
in it. I almost wanna mark up a 
copy for them. But -

Nancy reads the Love In Action handbook with interest by her 
bedside light. She frowns as we hear -

JARED O.S. (CONT’D)

- that would take away the only
real enjoyment you get from reading
it. Cause, I guess, it’s actually
not much fun to be there.

Whatever she has read - a rule, a task, or an ideology - it 
troubles her. She looks across at her son. 

JARED O.S. (CONT’D)

At least if you turn to page ‘87’ 
you can enjoy that the goofball 
that transcribed it was typing so 
fast -

Nancy, remembering, guiltily turns the page to eighty-seven --

JARED O.S. (CONT’D)

- he wrote ‘Dog’ instead of God.

We read the line as Nancy’s manicured finger runs along it. 
“...and so we always come back to Dog’s true design..

73.

JARED O.S. (CONT’D)

It’d be a shame to ruin the next 
poor kid’s fun.

Tight on Nancy as she smiles ruefully and whispers --

NANCY

Almighty Dog.

INT. THE EAMONS FAMILY HOME KITCHEN - NIGHT (FLASHBACK) 
Nancy washes dishes. We move in on her slowly from behind. 
The clatter of dishes. Then she stops, rock still.

She is crying. 

And we pull back - there behind her on the table is Jared’s 
gaming console. It’s the night Jared declared himself. 

-------------------------------------------------------------
TITLE CARD: NANCY 
-------------------------------------------------------------

She hears men entering the house and turns so we see her 
mascara stained cheeks. She leaves the room.

O.S. Sounds of Nancy vomiting.

INT. UPSTAIRS BATHROOM - NIGHT

Nancy post vomit, steps up to the mirror and, redoes her eye-
liner. With each application she calms herself with -

NANCY

Everything. Is. Going. To. Be --

Hearing noise she puts on her happy voice.

NANCY (CONT’D)

One minute.

JARED O.S.

Mom?

NANCY

Oh. Yes honey?

73A.

Why are Pastor Wilkes and Jim 
Picard here

JARED

(MORE)

JARED (CONT'D)

74.

NANCY

I think your father is having a 
meeting.

(no point lying)

Because of that call today and what 
you just told us.

(beat)

Pastor Wilkes has dealt with this 
kind of thing before. Jim’s son 
Sam. When you were just a boy.

JARED

What did they do to him?

Nancy smiles and then laughs. She embraces him.

NANCY

Oh, silly. They didn’t do anything 
to him. They did things for him. 
Just like your father is wondering 
what to do for you. To help you.

You go to your room. Everything is 
going to be okay. I promise.

(beat)

INT. STAIRWELL LANDING - NIGHT

Jared sits on the stairs, listening to murmured conversation 
but not being able to hear clearly. Suddenly Marshall appears 
at the base of the stairs.

MARSHALL

Can we see you in the kitchen 
please.

INT. EAMONS FAMILY KITCHEN - NIGHT

Jared, led by his father, enters the kitchen -

MARSHALL

You know Pastor Wilkes and Jim 
obviously.

Jared says his ‘hellos’, curious about the stack of brochures 
of a ‘Christian Nature’ that are piled on the table. The 
L.I.A. logo of the heart in a triangle is prominent here.

His father seems strung out and tired, but there is a 
paternal care and gentleness that still exists, despite

75.

MARSHALL (CONT’D)

We have one question and then I’ll 
let you sleep. It’s been a big day. 
I’ve shared our conversation with 
these two fine and trustworthy men 
and asked for their guidance. Now, 
we don’t have all the answers but 
you hold the key to the next step.

In your heart, do you wanna change?

(beat)

Hold. It is a big question.

MARSHALL (CONT’D)

And I have to be forthright here 
before you answer. I don’t think 
continuing to live and be part of 
things at home is going to be easy 
for you if the answer is ‘no.’ I 
don’t wanna make that a more bitter 
pill to swallow, but, if the answer 
is ‘no’ then I have to be tough and 
protect my needs with the ministry 
taking flight and my commitment to 
my whole flock. 

Your mother and I can’t see a way 
to have you under this roof and 
attending service and working at 
the dealership and driving that car 
if you go against the grain of our 
beliefs.

(beat)

There it is - an ultimatum. Jared looks at his mother, who 
can’t bear to look at him. In that moment he feels alone.

MARSHALL (CONT’D)

Well son?

LONG Pause.

JARED

Yes. Yes, I wanna change.

MARSHALL

I was hoping for a quicker answer. 
But, okay. 
(beat)

Can you be free in the morning for 
your mother to take you to see Dr. 
Muldoon? 

(Jared frowns/nods

(MORE)

MARSHALL (CONT'D)

76.

Then Pastor Wilkes has invited us 
to accompany him to the jail 
tomorrow.

(the Pastor’s steely look)

Take a seat -

They all link hands.

PASTOR WILKES

Heavenly Father. Look down on us 
now with your wisdom and unleash 
your power for one of your flock 
Jared, who has lost his way. We 
pray Lord that you make him pure.

Sound starts to fade out --

PASTOR WILKES (CONT’D)

And deliver him safely back to us. 
See the errors of his mind as 
nothing more than what it is - a 
momentary straying...

EXT. ARKANSAS STRIP MALL - MORNING

Jared and his mother walk. We follow them. Nancy puts on her 
dark glasses. She turns to look over her shoulder, like she 
is nervous they are being watched. That people know.

INT. DR. MULDOON’S WAITING ROOM - MORNING

Jared sits in a waiting room with a couple other folk. The 
door opens and Nancy and Dr. Beverly Muldoon (45) come out. 

DR. MULDOON

Jared.

(to Nancy)

I’ll see him alone if that’s okay.

Nancy takes Jared’s seat.

INT. DR. MULDOON’S OFFICE - DAY

Jared sits opposite doctor Jane.

DR. MULDOON

Your father has asked me to take 
some of your blood and check for 
testosterone levels Jared. Is that 
okay with you

(MORE)

DR. MULDOON (CONT'D)

77.

He shrugs.

DR. MULDOON (CONT’D)

You know, anything we discuss here 
is just between you and me. Both 
ways. I hope that’s okay?

He nods. She leans forward with kindness.

DR. MULDOON (CONT’D)

I’m in a little bind here Jared. 
And I said this to your mother too. 
Now I’m a religious woman no 
question, but I’ve also been to 
medical school. So I guess you 
could say I hold science in one 
hand and God in the other. And 
that’s not always an easy balance.

Jared seems confused so she drops the round-a-bout speak.

DR. MULDOON (CONT’D)

We won’t find any answers in your 
blood Jared. I wish I could say 
otherwise. And then send you to the 
pharmacy for a pill that will 
magically fix you. But that’s not 
going to happen.

On Jared.

DR. MULDOON (CONT’D)

I’m going to take your blood and I 
know what it will tell me. That you 
are a perfectly normal and very 
healthy teenage boy. It’s not my 
place to tell you your parents are 
wrong. But...

(beat)

There is a different opinion - a 
medical one - that says that they 
are wrong. And well -

(it hangs)

What happens next is still your 
choice. It may not feel that way, 
but it is. That’s all.

Jared hears what she is saying. He’s just not sure yet 
exactly what the ‘next’ is.

DR. MULDOON (CONT’D)

Do you have any questions for me

(MORE)

DR. MULDOON (CONT’D)

78.

He doesn’t. She looks at him with a maternal air and then, 
knowing what may be ahead of him, offers him this -

DR. MULDOON (CONT’D)

Well, just know you can call me any 
time. Now or anytime in the future.

She slides her card writing her cell number on the back. (We 
saw this card during Jared’s induction into L.I.A.) 

DR. MULDOON (CONT’D)
Okay. Which arm you want me to 
excavate?

INT. CAR DEALERSHIP/LUNCH ROOM - DAY

Jared, alone, eats. His sleeves are rolled up and a cotton 
bud taped in the crook of his left arm. He watches -

Through the glass, Nancy and Marshall in conversation with 
Big Jim. Jim heads for the lunch room.

JIM 

Hey pal. Your father wanted me to 
show you something. 

(beat)

I think your mom told you about my 
son Sam. Ten years ago he was in 
the same spot you’re in pretty 
much. Here -

Jared looks at the photo Jim hands him. A happy family 
portrait. A smiling middle-aged guy, a slightly overweight 
woman and their three children: a girl 8, and twin boys 5. 

JIM (CONT’D)

This is him today. Happy as a clam. 

(beat)

Don’t know if that helps. But... 
it’s all possible my friend. 

Marshall knocks on the door. ‘Ready?’ Jim tucks the photo 
back in his pocket, and pats Jared on the shoulder.

JIM (CONT’D)
I’m rooting for ya pal.

INT. PRISON - DAY

Jared trails Pastor Wilkes and Marshall as they go through 
the prison security check

78A.

. A big multi-bag of peanut M&M’s gets scanned along with 
three King James Bibles and pamphlets.

79.

MARSHALL

Candy to anyone who can recite at 
least two verses from the bible.

(beat)

If a want for candy tricks them 
into finding truth in the gospel, 
then -- We have to appeal to their 
lower natures before we can appeal 
to their higher ones.

Jared nods. Marshall, seeing Jared’s fear, offers him a 
reassuring pat on the shoulder.

INT. PRISON HALLWAY - DAY

Jared, terrified and wary, stands carrying the M&M bags. He 
watches as his father consoles a prisoner with truly great 
compassion. Then he hears his name called. Pastor Wilkes 
needs a bag of M&M’s. Jared steps closer to the cell he is 
in, trying not to make eye contact with the prisoner.

PASTOR WILKES

This is where the fallen land. You 
see? Look around you son.

INT. MARSHALL’S CAR - DAY

Marshall and Jared approach the car. Marshall eats M&M’s. 
Then hands the bag to Jared, who is still deep in memory of 
the pastor’s warning. They get in -

MARSHALL

You going to stay for dinner? Or --

JARED

I should probably make a start 
today.

Hold. Marshall puts his hand on Jared’s shoulder.

MARSHALL

We’ll get through this son.

Then Marshall turns on the radio: Credence Clearwater revival 
blasts out: There’s a Bad Moon on the Rise

80.

INT./EXT. JARED’S CAR/HIGHWAY - DAY

Jared on the side of the highway, where people only usually 
stop because their car has broken down. He is in the midst of 
a panic attack: trying to regulate his breathing.

He gets out and closes the door, leaning against the car. He 
manages to calm himself a little.

VRrrrmmm. The sounds of trucks racing past by catches his 
attention. Soon he steps forward, until -

He is very close to the edge. Might he just step forward and 
solve all his problems on the grill of a speeding semi? One 
driver HONKS a warning. Finally -

Jared walks back to the car, kicking out at the side mirror, 
breaking it. He gets back in the car and starts the ignition. 
His complicated life must keep going.

INT. HAMPTON INN AND SUITES - MORNING (PRESENT)

Nancy wakes up. She looks around. Jared is gone.

On his freshly made bed, she finds a note -

JARED

Decided to walk x c u @ 5. Sorry I 
was mean.

She finds a screwed up paper on the floor and unfurls it. 

PAPER

‘Moral Inventory.’ ‘Henry’ and 
‘Xavier.’ 

Henry has been scratched out. Nancy seems concerned. She 
moves to the bed and covers herself entirely with the sheet. 
Hold.

EXT. HIGHWAY - MORNING

Jared walks along the gravelled edge of the highway. He reads 
a handful of pages, rehearsing for his Moral Inventory.

Then - A pick-up pulls next to him. Jon’s brother’s car.

JON

Yo. Need a ride?

Jared sees Jon’s brother in the driver’s seat, eyes front

80A.

81.

JARED

Thanks, but I got a little while. I 
thought I’d walk. Looking through 
my stuff for today.

Jon understands: ‘Okay.’ The pick-up pushes on. Then -

Up ahead, it slows and stops. Then Jon gets out, slamming the 
door. His brother blasts the horn and completes a screeching 
U-turn as Jon walks toward Jared. Shrugs it off. 

CUT TO:

EXT. PATHWAY/PARK - DAY

Jared and Jon have taken a short cut through a park. Jared 
waits as Jon finishes peeing behind an old abandoned car.

JON

So, I got all these feelings in me, 
obviously. Toward men and so on. 
Have since I was thirteen or so. 
But I never did anything about it. 
Then, when I got older and 
discovered booze, I’d get real 
drunk and I’d let my guard down. 
Basically I’d wrestle guys and 
fight just to get the contact in a 
way that seemed okay. But, you 
know, people started to notice and 
talk. Guess I’d go too far too 
often.

(beat)

Then, one party, I get real drunk, 
I mean like super crazy drunk and, 
while a bunch of people are 
cheering me and watching me wrestle 
this kid, I kiss this dude, like 
full on, on the mouth.

I think in my haze I thought it was 
okay ‘cause I figured it would look 
like a domination over a kid 
everyone was already suspect over. 

(beat)

Jared listens, deeply curious.

81A.

JON (CONT’D)

Then I guess, I realized in the 
moment how it looked to everyone 
and I tried to start the wrestling 
charade again

(MORE)

82.

JON (CONT’D)

. But when I saw it wasn’t working, 
I had to do something and so --

(He sighs deeply)

I really started to whale on this 
kid... like choked him out and beat 
his face in... like bad, bad, bad, 
bad, bad. Bad. 

And when it was done I remember I 
stood up all messy, and put my fist 
in the air like I’d just won at the 
U.F.C or something whack... and I 
was waiting for the cheers, and --

(beat)

Jared waits - walks -

JON (CONT’D)

Everyone’s faces were like... dead 
still. Like -‘What the fuck just 
happened!?!?’

Pause.

Pause.

JON (CONT’D)

I haven’t been home since. 

(beat)

I’m sorry for it. But it’s also 
what got me to where I am. So...

(beat)

JON (CONT’D)

And I’m committed, I’m not here to 
waste anyone’s time, don’t get me 
wrong, but -

- I am what I am. I don’t think
there is any changing me and my
thoughts and whatnot. But I do know
by staying off the drink and making
certain choices, I can just choke
that side of me away. Put it aside.
There is a difference. Whether you
can actually change or just choose
different things.

Jared absorbs this. Jon knows he can’t change. He just 
believes he can put his desires in a drawer.

JON (CONT’D)

Haven’t touched another guy since. 
That’s why I don’t even shake hands 
you know. I’ve just decided that’s 
it for me. Whatever it takes

(MORE)

JON (CONT’D)

Jon kicks a rock.

83.

JON (CONT’D)

What’s your big crazy story?

What you got?

(beat)

Jared absorbs what he has on his meager pages...

JON (CONT’D)

Sykes’s gonna decide you know, 
based on what you say today, 
whether you stay another month, 
three months, six. A year.

Finally, Jared stops.

JARED

I don’t really have a crazy story. 
We, ah, probably shouldn’t walk in 
together.

And they walk in silence for some time --

EXT. L.I.A. HEADQUARTERS - DAY

Jared approaches to see Sykes on the steps conferring with 
two OLDER MEN. One, a striking man with silver hair and sharp 
features and, a shiny-bald stocky man. Both in their fifties.

Sykes sees Jared.

SYKES

Today’s going to run a little 
differently. I’ll be inside soon.

INT. L.I.A. MAIN AUDITORIUM - DAY

There is trash bag in the center of the room and, from it, 
the members of the group are trying on black and dark-blue 
blazer coats as instructed by Michael and Aaron. 

JON

What’s going on Michael?

MICHAEL

Sykes can tell you. Try this on.

Jon and Jared try on coats. They are handed ties too as -
Sykes enters looking troubled

84.

SYKES

Everybody sit down. Michael. Aaron. 
You can start on the windows.

Jared sees a MASSIVE roll of black material. Duct tape etc... 
He wonders: “what the hell is going on?!?”

And then the door opens and a couple of STAFF lug a funeral 
casket into the room. Aaron runs to help. 

SYKES (CONT’D)

Okay. We haven’t got much time and 
I need your help.

Sykes signs for the casket. Then he turns to the group.

SYKES (CONT’D)

There’s been a situation with 
Cameron overnight.

Everyone sinks. Is Cameron dead?!?!

SYKES (CONT’D)

Cameron has broken some serious 
rules and in conference with his 
father and their church elders, 
we’ve decided to offer him a 
chance. To shock him into recovery.

Jared is confused.

SYKES (CONT’D)

Today Cameron is going to choose to 
be dead to his life and to his 
family or to truly surrender.

INT. L.I.A. MAIN AUDITORIUM - DAY

The room is now cast in darkness, the windows blacked out. 
Candles flicker and dim lamps otherwise illuminate the room. 
The centerpiece is the casket. Slivers of sun infiltrate.

Jared, Simon, Jon, Carl... all are in attendance.

Jared looks across to a handful of NEW PEOPLE: CAMERON’S 
FAMILY and CLOSE FRIENDS: An OLDER BROTHER and SISTER. And 
TWO YOUNGER SIBLINGS. The two younger ones are confused and 
are teary-eyed. CAMERON’S MOTHER also attends along with 
Cameron’s LOCAL MINISTER (the balding man we saw earlier.) 
Plus a couple of FOOTBALL TEAMMATES, along with their COACH.

Sykes enters. He gestures for everyone to stand. He grabs a 
chair and sets it down beside the casket, facing the group

84A.

85.

SYKES

Here?

The BALD MAN nods approval. Sykes is not in control here. 
Then a knock at the door alerts him --

Sykes opens the door. Cameron, BLINDFOLDED, is led by his 
FATHER and Rev. Neil, the silver haired man.

Jared looks deeply concerned: It looks more backyard, 
improvised and pagan-like than truly Christian.

Brandon starts a classic funeral dirge on the Hi-fi system:  
OPUS 35 - Chopin.

Cameron is taken to his seat by the casket. They unmask him 
and, when he sees his family gathered together plus the 
casket, his weeping deepens. Understandably, he is scared.

Jared squirms.

REVEREND NEIL

Sadly, we are gathered here today 
to say farewell to our son, our 
brother and friend Cameron Van 
Huessen who, by his own making, 
last night fell prey to Satan’s 
wishes, falling farther away from 
God.

(beat)

But, the Heavenly Father in the 
wisdom of his mercy hasn’t had his 
last word on this boy’s soul -

Jared watches as --

-- Music starts drowning out the ‘service.’ The beatific - 
Moonlight Sonata by Beethoven.

----- as it plays, we see -----

Various images in slow motion to the music.

- Cameron wraps himself in his big arms and folds over. Sykes
attends him, holding him in place.

- Cameron’s sisters hug each other.

- The bald Minister opens the coffin as Cameron is led there
by Sykes and Rev. Neil. A pantomime where the message is
clear. Does Cameron want to DIE or BE REBORN.

- Cameron shakes his head fervently. He doesn’t want to die

85A.

86.

- They crowd around Cameron, offering an ultimatum. He nods
his head, still in tears, fully submitting.

- Sykes gestures to Aaron and Michael who rip the black
material off the walls letting the light in.

- Cameron kneels, eyes shut, hands up, surrendering himself.
Rev. Neil places a hand on Cameron’s head. In a wild, jolting
gesture he PUSHES to CAST the demons out.

- Others join him, doing the same.

- Cameron’s Father pushes Cameron’s head aggressively.
Cameron falls backwards to the ground.

- Cameron’s brother is handed a bible. He strikes Cameron
with it. Cameron’s anguished face as he rolls over, tears
streaming.

- Various people are encouraged to strike Cameron with bibles
and other books. Harder and harder they strike.

- Later: Cameron vomits in a trash can held by Brandon. Rev.
Neil brings him back to his knees.

- Jon is handed a bible. He stands, Jared watching him.

- Jon strikes Cameron with the bible.

- Cameron stands with the help of those around him. His
sisters are close.

The music carries through -

EXT. DRIVEWAY/STREETS - LATER

- Cameron walks the street, propped up by his father and
others. The full congregation snakes behind.

Jared is right up the back. Sarah near him. They share a 
look.

- They walk up the path toward a house: New Hope House. The
Men’s ‘long stay’ house we have been hearing of. Follow into -

INT. NEW HOPE HOUSE - DAY

Seen, through Jared’s P.O.V.: A suburban house with all doors 
removed and closed circuit surveillance cameras in the corner 
of EACH ROOM. HE notices, as they pass -

The ONLY DOOR in the house. It has two PADLOCKS securing it.

86A.

87.

INT. NEW HOPE HOUSE, BATHROOM - DAY

Jared watches through the crowd as Cameron is placed in the 
basic shower bath-tub of the small bathroom.

There he is baptized with his father and mother close, 
encouraged by Rev. Neil to place their hands on him.

His big body shudders and his strong arms reach out for the 
water. Like a massive baby. Full surrender.

Jared watches mute.

The only thing that makes this even remotely bearable is that 
Cameron, seems ecstatic and accepting of his REBIRTH. His 
arms clawing for God, reaching for a loving embrace.

Beethoven’s music underpins the whole horrible, beautiful,  
scene.

Jared sees Sykes on the edge of the action, involved but not 
really. Jared turns to go, unable to watch anymore. 
Interestingly, Sykes doesn’t try and stop him. But -

Jon does. He grabs for Jared’s arm. Jared shakes him off.

EXT. NEW HOPE HOUSE, HALLWAY - DAY

Jared moves into the hall, escaping the horror. He is alone.

GARY O.S.

Starting to see it for what it is? 

Gary is standing by the corner.

GARY

They catch him with another boy in 
a steam room and what do they do? 

(beat)

You seem smart. You want my advice? 
Tell them everything they need to 
hear and play the part. You’re up 
any day now. Let them know you’re 
understanding your mistakes, 
getting better, that it’s working. 
Think all my stories and my tears 
were real? ‘Fake it to make it’. 
None of this is going to help any. 
The sooner you are out of here and 
home the better. 
(MORE)

GARY (CONT'D)

And the sooner we are all out of 
home and somewhere else the better -

(that hangs

(MORE)

87A.

88.

GARY (CONT'D)

You don’t want to end up at one of 
these houses for any amount of 
time. I’ve heard the stories and 
they are not good. 

A muffled chorus and shout comes from the bathroom.

GARY (CONT’D)

Unless you really think you can 
change. Or want to.

INT. HAMPTON INN AND SUITES - NIGHT

The music continues as -

Jared walks the hall with his mother. Seen from behind they 
walk away and enter the room, leaving an empty hallway. Hold.

And the music ends on a deep base note -

EXT. MEMPHIS MOTEL MILE - NIGHT

Jared runs, exorcising the days events. Hood up, he pounds 
the pavement past the various motels. The rushing oncoming 
cars WHOOSH past like his dark thoughts.

Later: As he passes a bus shelter he comes to a stop. A strip 
mall in the background. Not a soul about. He takes a seat on 
a bench to catch his breath and when he looks back he sees -

On the outside of the bus shelter: a beatific advertising 
image of a SHIRTLESS GUY, lit and inviting. Jared looks away 
but something draws him back. His nature.

Then, something fierce wells up in him, and he gets up as if 
he is looking around for something. Leaves frame. Hold. We 
hear noises of effort. 

He soon returns with a heavy paving stone. He is about to 
launch the missile at the advertising image. However --

On the approach, the poster slides to the NEXT ad... a woman 
in a swim suit. It railroads his intentions.

JARED

Arghhhh.

He throws the paver anyway and it bounces off the Perspex 
shield, doing minimal damage. He sits down drained. Defeated

89.

JARED (CONT’D)

Fuck.

(turning skyward)

Fuck you. I hate you. Fuck you. 
FUUUUUUCK!

He waits. Nothing. Then -

The advertising image slides back, to the beatific male 
image. But, now buckled by the assault, its mechanism falters 
and sticks halfway. We move in on Jared. Recognition. Memory. 
The man, the face, albeit obscured with fracture glass, 
reminds him of something. Someone.

SNAP TO BLACK:

INT./EXT. JARED’S CAR/COLLEGE DORM BUILDING - LATE   
AFTERNOON (FLASHBACK)

Jared parks the car. He is dressed as he was the day of the 
prison visit. The day he had his panic attack on the highway 
and had thoughts of suicide. We know this too because when he 
gets out, he inspects the freshly broken side window.

INT. COLLEGE DORM BUILDING - EARLY EVENING

Jared lugs his overnight bag, dragging his feet. Depleted.

He lumbers past a bulletin board, then stops. Backs up.

An image of Christ. It’s a western depiction of Jesus where 
the man himself could have signed with a California modeling 
agency. The words ‘God vs. Science’ pop out. 

He steps closer and takes the flyer in his hands. It is 
advertising for a college art exhibition.

EXT. JARED’S DORM ROOM 346 - NIGHT

Jared unlocks his room. He notices, behind him, TWO STUDENTS 
whisper gossip about him. Has word gotten around somehow? 
Then he looks into the room -

INT. JARED’S DORM ROOM 346 - NIGHT

Inside, his room has been trashed. He enters cautiously.

Then he stops - Just above his bunk bed mattress is a crudely 
spray-painted message: ‘DIE HOMO.

89A.

90.

- He corrects a fallen chair and finds a bottle of wine.

- Room fixed up, Jared sits on his bed holding the bottle. He
turns over the flyer in his hands then puts it aside. He
opens the bottle sniffing the booze: ‘Die Fag’ behind him.

INT. LYON CAMPUS, ARTS BUILDING FOYER - NIGHT

A section of the Fine Arts building turned gallery space. 
People mill about. A decent crowd. Jared steps into frame.

He raises a glass of wine to his lips. He is staring at -

The Mormon style image of Jesus. The same ultra-color Blonde 
depiction as the flyer. The actual artwork is five feet by 
six. HUGE. We see that in Jesus’s hand is an image of a CELL 
PHONE. It’s controversial in a playful way. 

To Jared it is distasteful and somewhat irrelevant. Trite. He 
turns and places his drink down and suddenly stops, seeing --

A BEAUTIFUL BOY (20), gesturing to a small group about an 
image: MARY. Arms in offering, a Virtual Reality system on 
her face. Someone in the group shakes his hands in 
congratulations, and he nods humbly in thanks. This is the 
ARTIST. Xavier.

Jared is transfixed. Not by the image, but by Xavier.

And then Xavier catches him and looks right back. He steps in 
front of the image so that he appears Jesus-like. Divine:  
Mary’s offering arms seem to be his.

-----------------------------------------------------------

TITLE CARD: XAVIER

-----------------------------------------------------------

Jared does not turn away. Xavier gestures ‘cheers’ with his 
wine and moves away. Jared keeps staring.

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

Jared walks an expansive hallway alone. Soon -

Xavier comes into frame, following. Then he takes the lead.

INT. XAVIER’S STUDIO ROOM - NIGHT

They walk in together. As the door closes the music stops

90A.

91.

There is minimal improvised and eclectic furniture in this 
studio space. Beyond it Jared can see at the far end, a bed 
room lit by warm lamp light.

Xavier puts on Otis Redding - Change is Gonna Come. Vinyl.

XAVIER O.S

I’m having some wine. Do you want 
some more?

When Xavier speaks he has a slight European accent: French. 
Swiss? It is hard to tell.

Jared looks around at the motley pictures hanging: Subversive 
religious images; magazine cut-outs, plus; sketches of people 
and shapes. Curated by a novice, yet somehow captivating.

JARED

Where are you from Xavier?

XAVIER O.S

I lived in thirteen countries 
before I left high school. Born in 
Vienna. Ended up in Canada. Now 
here.

He approaches with a red wine. Jared takes it.

JARED

Do you believe in God?

XAVIER

Serious.

JARED

Why is that serious?

Jared is buoyed by drink. It is a bold side of him we have 
never seen. Perhaps some things are possible with booze that 
otherwise are not, as we may remember from Jon’s tale.

Like with that - this encounter should carry an edge that 
carries the possibility of that same danger.

JARED (CONT’D)

Do you believe in God or not? Your 
whole art thing is --

I do. I was raised with religion 
and I question it, but I still 
believe in God

XAVIER

(MORE)

92.

XAVIER (CONT'D)

JARED

Who created the earth?

Xavier laughs. That’s a BIG question?

XAVIER

You like a little small talk, huh? 

JARED

I don’t think you can believe in 
science and religion equally. 

Xavier frowns, not ready to engage in the seriousness.

JARED (CONT’D)

Don’t you think you have to pick a 
side? Don’t they cancel each other 
out.

XAVIER

Well, paper beats rock. Then no one 
can believe in God. 

JARED

Why?

XAVIER

Because science has shown itself 
and God has not. 

JARED

Sure he has.

XAVIER

Not all the time. Science shows 
itself all the time. It’s always 
around us developing. Does God show 
himself enough? Where is He? 
(off Jared’s expression)
Wait till you really suffer.

Jared seems to be getting either angry now or emotional. He 
may lash out, physically OR sexually... or totally crumble. 
It is hard to tell.

Xavier walks away.

When he comes back, he has a joint. He lights it. Jared has 
never been this close to drugs.

XAVIER (CONT’D)

Do you believe in the devil?

Jared’s silence is a yes

92A.

93.

XAVIER (CONT’D)

Does he look like me?

JARED

I don’t know.

XAVIER

Because he also doesn’t show 
himself.

Jared surprises us by taking the joint. He takes a toke. 
After a long beat.

JARED

You know Job? From the Bible.

XAVIER

Not personally.

Jared sees the humor in it.

XAVIER (CONT’D)

I hear he’s not great company. 
Always complaining.

Jared cracks up. Then gets real. He has to make his point.

JARED

I imagine I’m him sometimes. That 
God and the Devil are having a bet 
over me. That one day he’ll show 
himself to me and let me in on the 
experiment he was having to test 
me.

XAVIER

You just summed it all up.

(beat)

(beat)

People hoping someone is watching 
over them. That hard times are part 
of a design.

I think we are our own test. Our 
own judgement. Our own god. Meaning 
I think he is in us. All of us. Not 
somewhere watching and hiding.

Jared thinks about this.

XAVIER (CONT’D)

Stay with me.

Jared is not flinching

93A.

94.

XAVIER (CONT’D)

Nothing needs to happen. I swear.

Nothing from Jared.

XAVIER (CONT’D)

I’ll prove to you that God won’t 
strike you down.

JARED

What if you are the devil?

XAVIER

Then you are too. 

He backs away.

XAVIER O.S.

We are the same. I could be you or 
you could be me. 

Soon, Jared looks back for the door, but instead he watches 
Xavier who disappears into the warm glow of his bedroom den.

INT. XAVIER’S BEDROOM DEN - NIGHT

From above, Jared and Xavier lie down. The music filters in 
from the other room.

They look at each other.

They hold hands. And that’s it.

INT. XAVIER’S DEN - MORNING

Jared wakes up to full sunlight. Xavier is facing him asleep. 
Jared looks down. They are still holding hands, and still 
fully clothed. Jared slowly releases his hand from Xavier’s.

He stares for some time then finally moves out of frame.

INT. ARKANSAS STREET - DAY

Jared walks the street and lifts his phone to his ear. 

Dad. I’m ready. I’m coming home. 
I’ll go wherever you need me to

EXT. LYON COLLEGE, LAKE PONTOON - DAY

Jared naked from the waist up.

JARED

Please Lord, make me pure. 

And falls backward, right into the icy college lake. His 
clothes left piled on the shore nearby.

INT. HAMPTON INN AND SUITES, BATHROOM - NIGHT (PRESENT) 
Jared, dripping wet, stands before the mirror in his running 
gear, staring at himself. The shower runs in the B.G. Then we 
realize that he is looking at a card. It is the business card 
of Dr. Beverly Muldoon. He turns it over in his hands. 
Contemplating. Phone poised he actually starts to dial. Then 
he thinks better of it and takes off his shirt, walking into 
the steam.

INT. HAMPTON INN AND SUITES HALLWAY - MORNING

Behind: Nancy, in her Jackie O’s, and Jared walk the hall.

INT. L.I.A. HALLWAY - DAY

Behind: Jared walks the L.I.A. hallway.

INT. L.I.A. MAIN AUDITORIUM - DAY

Jared sits in his chair, clutching his papers and handbook, a 
purposeful steely look in on his face. He looks across and -

Cameron slowly eases himself into an empty seat. He 
acknowledges no one and sits, arms across his massive torso. 

Sykes moves to his podium.

SYKES

I don’t know about y’all, but today 
I feel invigorated. I feel hopeful 
that so much is possible.

Jared steals a look at Cameron. Cameron does not seem to be 
sharing the same vigor. He seems truly sunk.

SYKES (CONT’D)
Cameron. How do you feel

(MORE)

95A.

96.

SYKES (CONT’D)

CAMERON
I feel great, Sir.

SYKES

Do you feel the true presence of 
God in your heart?

CAMERON

Yes sir.

SYKES

It feels great don’t it?

CAMERON

Yes sir. It does for sure.

Jared catches Gary’s eye. A shared skepticism. Then he 
catches Jon’s eye, but Jared turns away almost coldly. Things 
have shifted between the two of them. Broken.

SYKES O.S.

Ready when you are, Jared.

INT. L.I.A. MAIN AUDITORIUM - MOMENTS LATER

Jared’s hands squeeze his papers for his Moral Inventory.

We hold on Jared’s face through --

JARED

I had thoughts of men. 

(beat)

Boys at school. On T.V. On the 
street. In my imagination. At 
college I held the hand of a boy 
and I stayed through the night. In 
his bed.

(beat)

For these thoughts and this action, 
for which I felt regretful, I -

SYKES O.S.

Hold on. And..? 

The faces of others. Of Jon. Aaron filming. 

I never... I stayed the night with 
the boy from college but we never 
did anything more. That’s the only

JARED (CONT'D)

SYKES

Come on Jared. Don’t hide your 
sins. God sees everything. What 
else?

Jared stews. He really is telling the truth. What happened 
with Henry was Henry’s sin.

JARED

I lied on my Genogram. My uncle 
Chris wasn’t an alcoholic.

Sykes sighs.

JARED (CONT’D)

It’s true.  How do you know?

SYKES

You want to waste everyone’s time?

I’m not. 

JARED

SYKES (CONT'D)

And mock everyone who has got 
up here being honest and 
brave.

JARED

I could make something up. Is that 
what you want me to do? Isn’t that 
a sin too?

He eyeballs Sykes. A new strength of defiance.

JARED (CONT’D)

If thoughts are a sin, I ask God’s 
forgiveness for that, but I’m not 
making anything up.

On Sykes. He eyes Jared: It seems like a stand off.

SYKES

Okay then. 

He moves off to get the lie chair. He sets it down in front 
of Jared. And places another chair beside Jared.

SYKES O.S

There’s your father. Sit down. 

Jared sits, albeit reluctantly.

97A.

Tell him how he’s affected you. 
Tell him how angry you are

SYKES

(MORE)

98.

SYKES (CONT'D)

(hold)

Tell him you hate him for --

Jared stands back up again.

SYKES (CONT’D)

Sit down. 

JARED

But, I’m not angry and I -

SYKES

Yes you are -

JARED

- he’s done things that upset
me and he’s let me down, but -

SYKES (CONT'D)
- you are angry and -

JARED

Why do I have to be angry? 

SYKES

Sit down Jared. Sit.

JARED

I’m not a dog.

(beat)

And I don’t think anyone is 
responsible for me. So - 

Jared continues to hold his ground.

JARED (CONT’D)

I don’t see how it’s going to help. 
Picking someone to blame or hate. 
Pretending we’re angry at someone.  

(to Aaron)

Can you stop filming me -

Aaron, tracking him, does not stop filming.

JARED (CONT’D)

I don’t hate anyone.

SYKES

Then why all this anger -

JARED

Because, you are making me angry. 

Then use it 

SYKES

99.

SYKES (CONT'D)

JARED

You are not listening to me.

MICHAEL

No! Stop!! You are not listening to 
him! You are not taking this 
seriously.

JARED

I am taking it seriously.

MICHAEL

You’re not. You’re pathetic, and a 
liar. And you don’t wanna change at 
all. He doesn’t want to change -

JARED

I do. I am. I just don’t agree. I’m 
not going to pretend to be angry. I 
love my father.

SYKES

I don’t think you do.

JARED

You don’t know me. You are all 
crazy. All of you.

Tina’s jaw is wide open. Gary smirks. Cameron is raising his 
eyebrows. 

Jared moves a few steps toward the door.

SYKES

Where are you going? You’re not 
going anywhere until --

JARED

You’re in my chair. There you go. I 
hate you. But how does that help? 

Jared is starting to breath heavily. Panic.

JARED (CONT’D)

I really want to go.

SYKES

Just take a minute.

JARED

I mean, how does any of this help? 
It’s crazy.

And he walks out

99A.

100.

.

EXT. L.I.A. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

The office door is locked. He knocks. Panic rising.

Sykes comes from the main auditorium. He is oscillating 
between tender and hard tactics. Tender it is -

SYKES

Jared? Son?
(beat)

Don’t open -

A FEMALE CLERK opens the door. Jared moves past.

JARED

I want my things.

SYKES

We’ll get your things, just come 
back and have a talk with me first.

JARED

I want my things now. And I want -

Jared just walks around and opens a drawer and finds various 
bags of people’s belongings. At one stage Michael rushes in 
and tries to intervene and Jared scuffles with him.

Finally, Jared finds his bag and grabs his cell phone from 
it. He leaves the room -

Sykes blocks his way to the exit. Jared retreats.

INT. L.I.A. MEN’S BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Jared storms into the bathroom and finds a stall and locks 
himself in. His breath is short now. Panicked.

JARED

(on the phone)

Mom. It’s me. I need your help. 
Come get me please. Like now.

(beat)

Please. I’m in trouble.

He waits. For a long time there is silence. Then voices on 
the other side of the door. Soon the door opens.

Go away

JARED (CONT’D)

(MORE)

100A.

JARED (CONT’D)

SYKES

!

Jared?

Jared.

(beat) 
(quietly)

Michael, get Brandon.

Jared is scared now. Shit. He has to get out. He prepares 
himself and then storms out past Sykes back into --

INT. L.I.A. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Jared’s way to the exit is blocked by Brandon and Aaron. 
Behind Jared are the other group members, all too scared to 
help or comment in any way. It’s a stand off: staff on one 
side, blocking the exit. Clients on the other side. 

JARED

I wanna leave, okay? Please.

SYKES

You are just having a rough moment.

JARED

‘A moment?!’ A moment? 

Steady on. I know it feels -

SYKES

I don’t want you to.

SYKES

JARED (CONT'D)

I don’t wanna talk. I wanna 
go.

JARED (CONT'D)

I read the rules and none of 
them say you can stop me from 
leaving. 

Sykes turns to Brandon. Mutters something. It’s certain he is 
asking Brandon to use his muscle to contain Jared.

JARED (CONT’D)

And if you or anyone puts their 
hands on me. I have witnesses.

(phone rings)

Mom? Where are you? If I put him on 
they might take the phone.

(listens)
How far away?

Heavy screeching outside and a minor collision. Then a door 
slam and -

Jared!

NANCY

(MORE)

101A.

!

NANCY (CONT'D)

Heavy POUNDING comes from the other side of the exit door.

102.

NANCY O.S.

(breathless and LOUD)

JARED!!! Honey? What’s happening?

JARED

Mom!! They won’t let me out.

NANCY O.S.

What!? Why? Who’s there with you?!

Sykes walks toward the door. Jared tries to too but Brandon 
blocks his way.

SYKES

Jared is having a moment born out 
of a role-play task. He thinks he 
wants to go because it brought up 
some issues for him but I think 
it’s best for his development that 
he doesn’t --

JARED

No. That’s not... Mom? Tell him he 
has to open the door.

SYKES

I’ll call Mr. Eamons, and you and I 
and Jared can all sit down to --

NANCY O.S.

Who exactly am I speaking to?

SYKES

This is Victor Sykes. We spoke on 
the phone a few weeks back.

(beat)

Missus Eamons. I think the thing to 
understand here --

NANCY O.S.

Open the door Mr. Sykes. Now! 
Before I call the police.

Hold. Jared waits. Sykes remains unmoved.

Then Cameron steps forward.

CAMERON

Open the door. 

It’s a HUGE moment: Cameron rebelling. He moves forward and -

102A.

103.

Puts his MASSIVE FRAME between Brandon and Jared, challenging 
the tough guy who once belittled him.

CAMERON (CONT’D)

He wants to leave.

Hold. Brandon stands his ground. But then something shifts. 
He knows, in this moment, he is the weaker of the two men. 

NANCY O.S.

CAMERON

Jared!?

Come on.

JARED

We’re coming.

Cameron escorts Jared all the way to the exit door.

Sykes too steps aside, having been overpowered by forces on 
both sides, allowing Cameron to open the door, 

The reveal of Nancy is AMAZING. She wears sweats and no make-
up or jewelry. This is what Nancy looks like when she doesn’t 
have to present. The real her. Naturally beautiful.

Jared shakes Cameron’s hand and then hugs him tight: Thanks. 
He eyeballs Sykes: ‘You got a problem with this?’

Now Jared joins Nancy as they start to move for the door. 
Then she turns sharply -

NANCY O.S.

What actual qualifications do you 
have Mr. Sykes? I never asked.

Hold. Great question. It hangs.

NANCY

Are you a doctor? A psychologist? A 
real proper one?

Nothing --

NANCY O.S.

Just as I thought. Shame on you. 
Shame on you. 

It’s true. No disputing it. Nancy and Jared continue to exit

104.

EXT. L.I.A. HEADQUARTERS - MOMENTS LATER

Jared and Nancy walk fast from the door to the car.

NANCY
They following?

JARED

No.

NANCY

Don’t look at me. I’m a mess. 

(beat)

You said hurry. 

They get in the car. And they drive away as fast as Nancy 
will drive. Maybe one spin of the tires.

Music starts -

INT. THE PEABODY HOTEL, MEMPHIS - EARLY EVENING

Jared sits alone in the affluent, green and cream dining hall 
of the famous hotel. It is early and almost empty.

WAITER

Can I help you?

JARED

I’m not sure if I’m staying or 
going.

Then Nancy arrives. Jared waits expectantly. She is done up 
again now, albeit a conservative version of herself. 

NANCY

Your father wants you to go back.

Hold. We can see Jared’s crest fall. Nancy sits. 

NANCY (CONT’D)

I told him... we’ll see him at 
home. I told him you are not going 
back. 

(MORE)

(beat)

That night Pastor Wilkes and Jim 
came to the house? 

104A.

NANCY (CONT’D)

Those men decided what to do with 
you, and I just fell into line like 
I usually do. Sometimes they say 
you gotta hurt a child in order to 
help them

(MORE)

105.

NANCY (CONT’D)

. And that may be so with some 
things, but a mother knows when 
something isn’t right, and I knew 
in my bones it wasn’t hurting to 
help. I was just letting you down 
and I kept my mouth shut. I’ll 
always regret that.

(beat)

So I’m going to do a different 
thing now I have a chance. I’ll 
handle your father. He can fall 
into line with me for a change. 

Jared allows his mother’s embrace. Now she lifts the mood.

NANCY (CONT’D)

I bet this hotel is “off limits?” 
Out of the “safe zone.” 

He smiles at her use of the L.I.A. jargon.

NANCY (CONT’D)

We may as well have a drink.

(small laugh)

One of my ideas, one of my many 
ideas, that I know would have made 
a lot of money... ‘Minister’s Wives 
Gone Wild.’ 

She gets up heroically, not an ounce of fear, and turns as if 
the brave should follow the brave - ‘come on’

NANCY (CONT’D)

Let’s go to the bar.

Jared smiles and stands, buoyed by her support.

INT. EAMONS FAMILY HOME - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Jared and his mother and father eat.

Given what’s happened you would think that there would be 
much discussion. Instead there is none. Maybe it’s already 
been had. Maybe it is to come. Or maybe not. 

Finally, Marshall takes his plate and leaves. Nancy and Jared 
share a look, and she keeps eating unperturbed.

Music continues 

106.

INT. JARED’S ROOM/EAMONS LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Jared sits on his bed. He unzips his L.I.A. bag. He raises 
his white shirt. Throws it in the trash. Behind him now as he 
unpacks, we hear a doorbell ring. He turns to register it but 
doesn’t pay too much mind. Moments later he hears a knock at 
his door.

NANCY

(knocking)

Honey.

Jared turns - 

NANCY (CONT’D)

Do you know a boy by the name of 
Cameron Van Huessen?

JARED

Is he here?

NANCY

No honey. That’s a sheriff. He’s 
come to ask you some questions. 
Apparently this Cameron boy killed 
himself today.

The world drops away. And much like Cameron’s fake funeral, 
we absorb his death in a similar fashion: slowly --

-- Jared sits to talk to a young sheriff. The sheriff takes 
Jared’s statement. Behind the sheriff -

-- Jared sees him father move away up.

-- The Sheriff is seen to the door and the whole family 
disperses into separate rooms.

- Jared walks into his room. He turns and sees his father
watching him. Jared closes his door.

SNAP TO BLACK:

FADE TO BLACK

107.

EXT. BROOKLYN STREETS - NIGHT (THREE YEARS LATER)

We follow Jared. A black coat. If it isn’t apparent, it will 
be as we take in his profile, and then his face full frontal 
as he turns the corner, that it is a few years later.

--------------------------------------------------------------

TITLE CARD: JARED 

--------------------------------------------------------------

It’s not so much that he has aged. More that he wears a new 
confidence that wasn’t apparent before. Under his arm he 
carries a six pack of craft beer and a bottle of wine. He 
approaches a building in an industrial area -- 

Jared puts a phone to his ear. An iPhone 1. (It is 2008)

JARED

I left my keys. They fixed the 
buzzer.

He buzzes and is buzzed up. We pull sideways to take in - New 
York City. The vast skyline.

OMITTED

INT. JARED’S SHARED APARTMENT - NIGHT

Jared and friends share a drink, post dinner. They are 
playing a board game.

Improvised scene from which --

We move back to see this action now in B.G. From a bedroom we 
discover is Jared’s. His phone sits beside his computer and a 
stack of papers. Perhaps we see certain things in the glow: 
An article with Jared’s name on it in an open journal 
magazine; a photo of him and his Mom posted on a board; 
Another of him and a boyfriend. Then, as we reach his iPhone 
and push in - it lights up and rings faintly. The vibration 
moves it toward the desks edge, until it finally stops 
teetering over the lip. The glow of the ‘unknown number’ 
finally goes away.

Back with Jared and his friends. Unaware of who was calling 
him and what it would potentially mean, Jared continues 
laughing and playing.

LATER: The kitchen is empty. The bottles and dishes can wait 
for another day. We hear Jared farewell a friend O.S

107A.

108.

OMITTED

INT. JARED’S BROOKLYN BEDROOM - LATER

Jared works. Now lit by the screen of his desktop, we see 
evidence of the writer Jared has become. We pick off various 
things including a post-it note saying ‘write what you 
know!!’ 

Jared types furiously and when an email pings he immediately 
switches to his email page: an email from - Nancy Eamons: 
“URGENT -- I WAS RIGHT!!” How could he not open it -

A news article: A BOY WHO LOST HIS ARM, HANGING IT OUT OF A 
CAR IN IBIZA.

Then another PING: He sighs, she has hooked him again, 
dragging him from work into a text chat.

MOM: Are you coming for Thanksgiving?

JARED: I don’t know I can.

MOM: Your dad would love to see you.

JARED: I’ll come when Dad is away at the convention.

Then the phone rings. He snatches it up -

JARED

Mom! I’m working.

Pause. Then a PING on the computer - Again it is -

MOM: Okay. Goodnight.

Then, who is on the phone!

VOICE

Is this Jared Eamons?

JARED

Yeah. Who’s this?

Jared walks out to the fridge in the darkened kitchen to grab 
another beer --

VOICE

From L.I.A. a few years ago?

He stops. Moves back to the bedroom and turns off the music. 
Now there is utter silence 

108A.

109.

JARED

Who is this?

VOICE

It’s ah... It’s Victor Sykes.

Hold.

SYKES

Before you hang up. Please hear me 
out. I’ve been contacting as many 
ex-clients as I can...

Jared listens and Sykes’ call drowns out. We move behind 
Jared’s head as he listens and we hear faint traces --

When we come across to Jared’s other side of Jared we hear a 
fierce and firm drum snare SNAP!

THEN TO BLACK:

Then a drum roll rumbles over -

EXT. BROOKLYN STREET - DAY

A truck passing reveals Jared’s face cautiously standing on 
the street keenly watching something. He puts his phone to 
his ear. Another drum beat and we see - the drumming actually 
comes from a TEEN BOY right by Jared. Jared looks at him for 
a moment.

Jared’s friend, one we saw from the night before steps up.

FRIEND

He’s in there. Well, from your 
description, I think he is.

(Jared tenses)

You don’t have to do this you know.

And with that, Jared moves off.

FRIEND (CONT’D)
Call if you need back up.

INT. BROOKLYN CAFE - DAY

Jared pokes his head in. He looks around --

Jared turns the bend cautiously and looks around.

A man stands -- It is Sykes. He looks different. A new 
haircut. A grey goatee. Loose clothing. Transformed.

109A.

110.

SYKES

Jared. Thanks for this.

JARED

How did you get my number?

SYKES

I tried the one I had on file.

They sit.

SYKES (CONT’D)

I’m sorry to jump out of nowhere 
and contact you.

Sykes seems interminably nervous. Not his L.I.A. self. He 
rummages through a shoulder bag.

SYKES (CONT’D)

I said I had some things for you.

Jared is just watching and waiting. Uncomfortable.

SYKES (CONT’D)

There’s a few things about me you 
don’t know. And, well, reading the 
article I figured it was about time 
I made contact with you.

(beat)

Try and make some kind of peace.

Sykes finds what he wants to give, handing it over: The torn 
out pages of Jared’s Moleskin from all those years ago.

SYKES (CONT’D)

I kept everything. When I left --

Jared is trying to compute everything.

SYKES (CONT’D)

I couldn’t recognize it at the time 
but they really were... are very 
good. The stories.

You look well. And seem good. So --

(beat)

(beat)

Listen, I don’t know where to start 
but I want you to know that I’ve 
left the ministry and L.I.A. and 
well, I guess you could say I’ve 
turned my back on all of it.

On Jared, absorbing

110A.

111.

Sykes pushes a picture across the table - Jared picks it up. 
A picture of - Sykes with his arm around a man.

Jared, feelings welling, gets up and heads for the restroom.

INT. RESTROOM - CONTINUOUS

Jared closes the door. And it is here, of all places, and in 
this moment that Jared finally releases emotion. His shaking 
hands wipe a tear and he tries to suppress it. But then -

It’s too much and IT ALL COMES OUT.

INT. BROOKLYN CAFE - CONTINUOUS

Sykes waits patiently at the table. He peruses the menu. Then 
his phone rings.

INT. RESTROOM - CONTINUOUS

Jared wipes his eyes and speaks on the phone. 

JARED

It’s Jared. Hey. I, um... no 
offense, but could we try this some 
other time. 

INTERCUT WITH Sykes. Empathetic, he listens. Something ironic 
in the image of him now facing an empty chair.

SYKES

I understand. Of course.

INT. BROOKLYN CAFE - CONTINUOUS

Sykes slowly gets up from the table and makes his way out.

INT. RESTROOM - CONTINUOUS

Jared has calmed now. He steadies his breathing, until he’s 
ALMOST calm again. As we see this, we hear --

OMMITTED

OMMITTED

111A.

112.

EXT. EAMONS FAMILY HOME - DAY

Jared’s car pulls into the family driveway.

JARED O.S.

Where is he?

INT. EAMONS FAMILY KITCHEN - DAY

Jared stands in the kitchen table, on a mission. Fierce. (NB: 
Nancy is slightly less ‘made-up’ these days)

NANCY

Honey. It’s Sunday. If it’s urgent, 
you’ll have to go to the church.

JARED

I’ll wait for him to get back.

NANCY

You haven’t even seen it. Not with 
all the fittings and filled with 
people. He’s so proud of it.

(beat)

Like he’s proud of you.

JARED

Mom, he lost part of his 
congregation on account of me. 

NANCY

You’ve made that a bigger deal than 
it ever was. Honey -

(beat)

What is the matter? Is everything -

JARED

Why aren’t you there? At church.

NANCY

I don’t always go. I do to support 
your father sometimes. But, he 
knows. I have my own religion.

(off Jared’s expression)

Everyone else creates religions to 
suit themselves, so I figured, why 
couldn’t I.

INT. NANCY’S CAR - DAY

Nancy at the wheel. The sun sheds a warm glow on Nancy

112A.

113.

NANCY O.S.

I love God and God loves me. And I 
love my son.

Nancy turns to smile. Jared returns the look.

INT. EAMONS FAMILY KITCHEN - AS BEFORE - DAY

Jared listens to his mother’s religion -

NANCY

And if He doesn’t love my son too, 
then I will stop loving Him.

Jared wipes a tear, trying not to be drawn into feeling -

NANCY (CONT’D)

For your father it is a little more 
complicated than that.

EXT. ARKANSAS HIGHWAY - MOMENTS LATER

Nancy’s car travels the highway. Her car peals left and we 
continue up the highway.

NANCY

Your call. Church left. Or right if 
you wanna go see a movie instead.

INT. HOPE SPRINGS FIRST BAPTIST MINISTRY - LATER

Jared enters from the podium side with his Mother as The 
choir belts out the final bars of - ‘Someday’

As Jared sits, he catches eyes with Chloe who enters with 
Wayne (a new couple). Chloe, surprised, offers a small smile. 
Wayne, however, blanks him. Then the crowd settles: Marshall 
is heading down the aisle, greeting folk when  --

He sees Nancy and offers a smile, before spotting Jared. He 
freezes a beat, but then covers and offers a mini salute.

Jared turns back, focusing his eyes to the front as --

113A.

MARSHALL

The night before the crucifixion. 
Jesus and the disciples are heading 
down the Kidron Valley toward the 
Garden of Gethsemane. Vines are 
everywhere.

(MORE)

MARSHALL (CONT'D)

114.

On Jared, aware that his presence has created a stir.

MARSHALL (CONT’D)

So Jesus pointed to the vines and 
said these words: ‘Just like those 
grapes depend on the vine, so 
should you depend on me.’

On Jared focusing on his father, in his element. You can tell 
he is charismatic as the congregation hang on his words.

MARSHALL (CONT’D)

‘Be fruitful’ is the subject of 
today’s sermon.

EXT. CHURCH PARKING LOT - EARLY EVENING  
Jared and Chloe walk in silence until they reach Nancy’s car.

WOMAN O.S.

Goodbye, Jared.

Jared turns and waves to the WOMAN getting in her car.

CHLOE

See? Not everyone wants you to burn 
in hell.

She hits him playfully. They hear a car horn BLAST. A large 
pick-up cruises in the background: Wayne. As Jared and Chloe 
hug goodbye, Wayne sounds the horn, sharply, one more time. 
Jared watches Chloe totter to the car. Once she’s in, the car 
lurches and stops. Then Wayne gets out. He approaches Jared. 

WAYNE

Yo. Chloe wanted me to apologize.

JARED
It’s okay Wayne.

WAYNE

Just shake my hand. 

(he does. Wayne grips)

Stay away from her. Yeah? We don’t 
wanna see you again around here. Or 
you and me got trouble.

JARED

You’re on my father’s property.

114A.

Your father agrees with me. You are 
an abomination. Don’t come near us

WAYNE

(MORE)

WAYNE (CONT'D)

(heading for the car)

Or, I swear to God I’ll get my M-4 
and put one in your skull.

True hate right there. But Jared meets it with kindness.

115.

JARED

You know Wayne. You or anyone 
could’a been born just the same.

WAYNE

Then I’d shoot myself.

NANCY O.S.

We could arrange that Wayne. I’m 
sure there’s plenty of guns here.

Jared turns to see Nancy has arrived back at the car.

NANCY 

Okay. Sorry. Sorry.

JARED

It’s okay. Wayne was just leaving.

EXT. EAMONS FAMILY HOME - PORCH - NIGHT

The yard is dark and still in the approaching winter. Jared 
sits alone, ruminating on all things when the door opens.

MARSHALL

I’ve got some work to do and then 
I’m going to turn in. 

JARED

Ministry looks good, Dad.

MARSHALL

Glad you could make it. Well, if I 
don’t see you early, I’ll see you 
in a few weeks at Christmas.

JARED

I won’t be here for Christmas.

Marshall stops. Nods. It is what it is.

JARED (CONT’D)

Did you hear about the article in 
the Times I’ve got coming out?

(hold - he does)

Do you know what it’s about

(MORE)

JARED (CONT’D)

116.

MARSHALL

(he knows)

Listen I don’t want to get into a 
fight. Your mother told me about -

JARED

It’s not a fight. I’m just doing 
the right thing. Letting you know. 

(beat)

I’ve written more, and the 
publishers are talking about me 
putting together a whole book. You 
don’t need to read any of it, but I 
just needed you to know that it 
might be out there. And --

MARSHALL

Yeah. Well, now I know.

Jared is arming up for a confrontation. Hard as it is.

JARED

But, it might be good for you to 
read... because you also never 
really asked what went on there.

(beat)

You never really knew the staff or - 

And Marshall continues inside, leaving Jared unresolved.

INT. EAMONS FAMILY HOME KITCHEN - NIGHT

Marshall makes notes for a sermon, his bible beside him. 
Suddenly, a newspaper placed down: Jared’s article (A few in 
fact). Nancy holds Marshall’s look. She picks up the bible.

NANCY

I think you’ve read that one.

He goes to take her hand but she moves off. We see Jared in 
the background, like he did the night Pastor Wilkes and Jim 
helped determine his fate, peering through the door. 

EXT. EAMONS FAMILY HOME - EARLY MORNING

Jared loads his car. He closes the trunk. He looks to the 
house. His dad is not coming to say goodbye. He hugs his mom. 

Jared is about to drive away. But his mom knocks on the 
window and Marshall appears at the passenger window.

116A.

117.

MARSHALL

You mind driving me to the 
dealership? Got some stuff to 
organize.

Marshall gets in and they pull away. Nancy waves good bye.

OMITTED

INT. JARED’S CAR - EARLY MORNING

Jared drives and looks across to - Marshall deep in thought, 
his eyes trained to the front.

EXT. CAR DEALERSHIP - MORNING

Jared gets out of the car as his father moves toward the 
entrance. His father turns --

MARSHALL 

Come on in for a second.

INT. MARSHALL’S DEALERSHIP - MORNING

Marshall turns, looking around in the expansive showroom. He 
seems confused. Agitated.

JARED

Is there anything you need help 
with? Otherwise I should --

Jared turns hesitantly, to leave. But then -

MARSHALL

Hold on. This was going to be for 
Christmas. 

(he hands Jared keys)

It’s an Explorer. Your mother said 
you and your friends drive up --

Dad. I live in New York. I don’t 
need a car. 

(beat)

I don’t want to pretend anymore. 
It’s okay Dad. I’m okay without all 
this. 

JARED

JARED (CONT'D)

Unless we are going to speak to 
each other properly. Like -

(beat

117A.

JARED (CONT'D)

I’m gay. I’m gay and I’m your son. 
And neither of those things are 
going to change. 

118.

Hold. Marshall breathes. He looks out over the dealership -

MARSHALL

This was all going to be yours you 
know? 

(beat)

(beat)

Still will be. I meant, to run and 
make a living from. But, I know you 
got other fish to fry.

I ran your grandfather’s mill, like 
he wanted, until I had the gall to 
tell him I didn’t want that.

He is still looking around, not making eye contact. Then --

MARSHALL (CONT’D)

I stayed up all night trying to 
think of good reasons to convince 
you to keep everything to 
yourself... the book and whatnot... 
but then I thought that would be 
like your grandpa forcing me to run 
the mill.

Jared listens.

MARSHALL (CONT’D)

I like to do what I want, so who am 
I to get in anybody else’s way? 

He turns to Jared.

MARSHALL (CONT’D)

The truth is I do want you to do 
well and have a good life. I know 
we don’t agree on a handful of 
things. And, I realize by what’s 
happened, I’ve set myself up to 
lose you. I had to ask myself and 
God if I was ready for that. 

(beat)

Your mother said a prayer that she 
got comfort from. Whether it was 
her that needed to change and not 
you... My prayer didn’t so much 
give me comfort. I don’t think I am 
ready to lose you and so I wanted 
to let you know -

MARSHALL (CONT’D)

119.

Marshall is not the eloquent man he was in church.

MARSHALL (CONT’D)

-- that I am going to try. I’m 
sorry it’s not more, and I 
understand if that is not good 
enough for you. That’s on me.

(beat)

Son, I tend to be more eloquent in 
front of full congregation than 
this. I guess, I prepare for that.

He takes a big breath in and out. Smiles ruefully.

MARSHALL (CONT’D)

‘I’m trying’ is the subject of 
today’s sermon.

Marshall hangs his head. Jared steps forward and hugs him. 

JARED

Mom is coming to New York for 
Christmas. You are welcome to come 
too. Have a think about it.

Hold wide as father and son embrace. Then Jared removes 
himself and sets the keys down.

If It Be Your Will - by Leonard Cohen as sung by Antony and 
the Johnsons starts and carries through --

INT. JARED’S CAR - DAY

Jared drives free and alone along a stretch of Arkansas 
countryside. He cracks the window to let in the warm breeze.

And his hand goes out the window to dance in that breeze.
