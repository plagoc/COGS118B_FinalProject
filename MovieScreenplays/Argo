INT. BATHROOM STALL - DAY

LUKE KNOWLES, late 20s, a slight Texan drawl. His face is 
bruised and his mouth is swollen. He’s cowering on the floor 
of the stall next to a toilet filled with vomit and shit. He 
speaks quietly and urgently.

KNOWLES

She’s looking at me, is first of 
all, she’s staring at me like a 
Chinese waiter and the dress, 
Shirley Temple, Good Ship Lollipop, 
she’s saying off, take it off her, 
and I hear it, school p.a., Voice 
of America, and it’s loud, it’s 
saying, This is not a clean world. 
This is a dirty world. So I said 
it, I said, ‘Here I am Lord. I got 
no strings to hold me down so You 
Show Me. You show me how to clean 
this dirt -- 

Someone -- and we can only see his back -- leans down, close 
to Knowles. Tries to pick him up. Knowles recoils. Then, a 
voice. It’s quiet, and patient, and it feels like safety.

MENDEZ (O.S.)

Look at me. I will help you, but 
you need to trust me. This is what 
I do. I get people out.

A blank look on Knowles’s face. Unclear whether he 
understands this, or anything.

The reverse: TONY MENDEZ, mid-40s, our hero. Fifth generation 
American. He’s had 19 years with the CIA and he’s the best 
exfiltration specialist the agency’s ever had. 

MENDEZ (CONT’D)

Take a minute.

And Knowles nods. Barely, but he nods.

INT. BATHROOM - DAY

Tony leaves the stall and closes the stall door. We’re in an 
empty and decaying bathroom in need of a Five Year Plan.

Super: MOSCOW - March 6, 1979

And a MAN IN A BLACK COAT, 30s, enters. Goes to a rusty sink 
to wash his hands. Tony stands next to him, washing his own 
hands, and speaks, barely moving his lips. 

MENDEZ

Who was she?

The man -- BURROUGHS -- answers, as quietly, and in American 
English.

2.

BURROUGHS

A prostitute. He used her 
stockings. Around her neck.

MENDEZ

How the fuck did he get past 
O.M.S.?

BURROUGHS

Every screening with flying colors. 
No schizos in the family... Tony. 
Ops just gave a stand-down. 
Colman’s saying give him up to the 
ments. Disown.

MENDEZ

He had full officer status. He  
comes out.

BURROUGHS

You’re not authorized.

Mendez turns the faucet to full and leans in to Burroughs, 
holding his arm. Hard.

MENDEZ

(in Burroughs’s ear)

In his rotting brain is the name of 
every embassy chauffeur and typing 
girl he’s ever brought in for us. 
We disown, he talks, they die.

Mendez holds out his hand. Burroughs hesitates. Then hands 
over two PASSPORTS with burgundy covers.

Knowles, now standing, opens the stall door.

INT. LENINGRADSKY RAIL STATION - DAY

Mendez, guiding Knowles, who moves his lips like an autist. 
They walk out a door where a BATHROOM ATTENDANT, a pensioner 
in her 70s with an Eisenstein face, sits outside with a 
change cup. 

And they move into the crowds of a busy Old World-style rail 
station with a drab Soviet make-over, a bust of Lenin on a 
pedestal.

3.

Mendez leads Knowles past SOVIET GUARDS wearing shapkas and 
holding automatic weapons. Down a train platform where signs, 
in Cyrillic and Latin alphabet, show the destination: 
HELSINKI. To the second car of a boarding train. 

INT. TRAIN - DAY

A KGB BORDER OFFICER waits inside the train, at the door to 
the cabin. Mendez gives him one of the burgundy passports. 
Knowles, on another planet.

MENDEZ (RUSSIAN)

My brother is ill. I’m taking him 
home to Helsinki. 

Border Officer looks at Knowles, then at the passport -- it’s 
a FINNISH PASSPORT with Knowles’s picture. Border Officer 
waves Knowles into the car and Knowles goes. But he STOPS 
Mendez.

BORDER OFFICER (RUSSIAN)

Your passport.

Mendez looks into the crowded car where Knowles now moves 
down the crowded aisle. He gives the Border Officer another 
burgundy passport. Border Officer opens it: another FINNISH 
PASSPORT with Mendez’s picture on it. 

Now Knowles is invisible behind passengers jamming luggage 
into the overhead racks.

Border Officer feels the texture of Mendez’s passport. Holds 
it up to light. Looks at the name and address again.

BORDER OFFICER (CONT’D)

(now, speaking in FINNISH)

You live on Temple Street. Near the 
food stalls.

MENDEZ

(answering in FINNISH)

No, sir. The food stalls are in 
Market Square. On the other side of 
the city.

It was a test. The Border Officer, satisfied, nods Mendez  
through. 

Mendez, moving inside the railroad car, scanning the seats. 
No Knowles. Pushing past Russians in the aisles. Still, no 
Knowles. 

4.

Now Tony, on the opposite end of the cabin, goes to the door 
of the train looks out onto the platform. Hears a voice. In 
English.

KNOWLES (O.S.)

Look!

Knowles, standing at the edge of the track opposite.

KNOWLES (CONT’D)

(yelling to Tony)

I’M CLEAN NOW!

And with that, Knowles STEPS OFF THE PLATFORM AND IN FRONT OF 
A TRAIN that is pulling onto the opposite track.

A moment while this lands on Tony. Then, alarm sirens. 
Russians converging from all directions, rushing to the 
tracks.  

Tony stands at the door, watching, as his train starts up and 
pulls away.

FADE TO BLACK.

WARNER BROS. presents (etc.)

An AMERICAN FLAG is burning in the street. We’re watching 
ARCHIVE FOOTAGE of anti-American protests in Tehran, in front 
of the American Embassy. The long-accruing rage of a long-
suffering population has found its outlet here, at a black 
gate on Avenue Taleghani.

Effigies of Jimmy Carter -- crowds chanting “Magbar Cartar! 
Magbar Ahmrika!” -- fists in the air.

Then, in a famous piece of archive footage, something simple 
happens. A YOUNG MAN IN A SWEATER climbs the gate and makes 
it to the other side. Maybe we see it happen twice or three 
times, or magnified.

Super: TEHRAN - NOVEMBER 4, 1979

And now, we see the REVERSE of that famous shot. This isn’t 
archive footage any more. We’re looking at the The P.O.V. of 
a MARINE from within the U.S. Embassy, from Guard Post Number 
One.

MAIN TITLE over a CLOSED-CIRCUIT TELEVISION image: IRANIAN 
PROTESTORS are coming over the fence.

VOICE OF MARINE

Fort Apache is breached. Fort 
Apache is BREACHED.

INT. U.S. EMBASSY, CHANCERY - MORNING

Total chaos inside the Chancery, the nerve center of the 
embassy. ANN SWIFT, 39, thick glasses, Deputy Political 
Officer. 

5.

ANN SWIFT

(on the phone)

... a dozen, a couple dozen ...

(she looks to an AIDE by 
the window)

Okay now he’s saying hundreds... 
Bruce? He’s saying hundreds.

EXT. U.S. EMBASSY GROUNDS - MORNING

YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN -- about 2/3 men 1/3 women -- the men 
dressed in sweaters, button down shirts, some with flak 
jackets; about half the Young Women wear full chador, the 
others sweaters, jeans, and veils. They are now screaming and 
shaking their fists at the doors to the Chancery Building. 
Many of them wear bibs with pictures of AYATOLLAH KHOMEINI. 

When one YOUNG MAN wearing a green military field jacket 
raises his fist, we can see that he has a concealed AUTOMATIC 
WEAPON in his clothes.

INT. CHANCERY - MORNING

The noise of the crowd outside -- the sound of DOCUMENT 
SHREDDERS, everyone on a different phone. It’s like an 
emergency room where the patient is the whole building.

ANN SWIFT
Now Al’s ... Hello?
(on the phone)

Al’s saying they just want to stage 
a sit-in ... yeah, I think ... Does 
Ed have the Ministry? Can we get 
some fucking police please?

INT. MARINE GUARD POST 1 - MORNING

MARINE JIMMY GALLEGOS, 20s, hangs up a phone. To another 
Marine.

JIMMY GALLEGOS

(trying to process what he 
just heard)

He says don’t fire. He says open 
the gates.

6.

U.S. EMBASSY GROUNDS - MORNING

A WIDE of the gates opening and A FLOOD OF HUMAN BODIES 
entering the compound.

Then, the sound of women wailing and praying --

INT. U.S. EMBASSY, TEHRAN; CONSULATE BUILDING - MORNING

It’s two IRANIAN WOMEN in chadors in the floor, praying for 
deliverance. This is the part of the Embassy that grants 
visas, and these people were applying this morning.

The LIGHTS in the building go out and there is a SCREAM from 
the women. Move past them to find...

SIX EMBASSY EMPLOYEES -- four men, two women (much more about 
them later) are in a kitchen area in the office. 

One of the six, LEE SCHATZ, 33, has taken from his wallet a 
battered holy card with the Infant of Prague on it and is 
mouthing a prayer to himself.

MARK LIJEK, 29, is attending to his wife CORA LIJEK, 26, who 
is sitting on the floor, breathing heavily.

BOB ANDERS, 55, an embassy consular officer, on the kitchen 
phone.

BOB ANDERS

(on the phone)

... yeah ... yes ...
(to the others)

Ann wants us to stay where we are.  
Police are coming --

EXT. U.S. EMBASSY GROUNDS - DAY

An IRANIAN POLICE OFFICER kisses one of the PROTESTORS on the 
cheek in a warm gesture. Another APPLAUDS.

Hell breaking loose. Now there must be a THOUSAND ANGRY 
PROTESTORS on the Embassy grounds. YONUNG MEN now carry 
AUTOMATIC WEAPONS openly. A YOUNG WOMAN IN A CHADOR speaks 
into a captured Marine walkie: the sight is bizarre, like 
seeing a nun with a gun.  A BEARDED YOUNG MAN in a green 
jacket smashes a basement window on the Chancellery Building.

INT. CONSULATE BUILDING - MORNING

KATHY STAFFORD, 28, is now attending to Cora.

7.

MARK LIJEK

Wolf-pack, Joe --

JOE STAFFORD

Listen to me.

MARK LIJEK

My wife is pregnant -- she can’t 
breathe -- I’m not taking her 
running through the goddamn --

JOE STAFFORD, 35, consular officer, choosing his words to the 
other five in his group.

JOE STAFFORD

(interrupting)

Listen to me. We are in the only 
building with an exit direct to the 
street, away from the riot. We are 
going.

A hand on Mark Lijek’s shoulder. He turns around. Cora, now 
standing up. She nods at her husband.

And we start to hear the sound of a CROWD shouting --

ARCHIVE FOOTAGE

The much-played clip of AL GOLACINSKI, embassy security 
chief, blindfolded, being prodded and led down the front 
stairs of the embassy. Angry Crowds jeering at him.

MALICK (V.O.)

At least 60. They say they’re not 
letting them go til we expel the 
shah.

INT. STATE DEPARTMENT OPERATIONS CENTER - 3:30 A.M.

All hell breaking loose here too -- telexes from all over the 
world -- KERRIGAN, MALICK, BRICE, 30s, State Department mid-
level Aides entering the Ops Center.

KERRIGAN

These fucks can hit us, we 
can’t hit back?

Mossadeq -- Banquo’s ghost --

MALICK

BRICE

(to Kerrigan)

A fly can’t bird but a bird can 
fly.

ANALYST

(entering, to 
Lieutanant)

We’ve got a red coming in 
from 0-12 -- Canada --

KERRIGAN

Why’d we let the prick into 
the country? 

MALICK

Things have consequences. We de-
balled an entire population --

8.

SUPER: S/ES-O, STATE DEPARTMENT OPERATIONS CENTER

ANALYST 2

Ah-yup, sombody’s lobster 
trap drifted into their wah-
tahs -- No doot aboot it --

KERRIGAN

You think the fucking 
Russians would put up with 
this? I’m serious --

BRICE

(to Analyst 2)

Get rid of it --

Analyst 2 picks up the ringing line.

ANALYST 2

(picking up phone)

Operations.

PUSH IN on Analyst 2 as he listens.

ANALYST 2 (CONT’D)

(to the others)

Shhhhhhhhh....

(then)

Hold on holdonholdonholdon --

INT. STATE DEPARTMENT, SEVENTH FLOOR - NIGHT

HICKEY, 40s, balding, skinny, perpetually stressed. He picks 
up a phone.

HICKEY

... with the Canadians? 

(he covers the phone, to 
the room)

Five got out!

INT. STATE DEPARTMENT, SEVENTH FLOOR - NIGHT 

Setting up a war room in the background. Fluid -- camera 
seems to glide from scene to scene -- Hickey charges down a 
hallway. Kerrigan and a couple of Hickey’s guys, WEINER and 
BATES, follow.

KERRIGAN

Six.

HICKEY

Gulden told me five.

BATES

(turning behind him)

Schafer! Schafer!

WEINER

(entering)

You still haven’t found 
Schafer?

9.

KERRIGAN

(to Hickey)

Six now. Another one joined 
them. Six.

How’d they get out?

HICKEY

BATES

No, I was screaming his name 
cause cause I was fucking 
him.

I guess they -- ran.

KERRIGAN

HICKEY (CONT’D)

(to Brice)
Oh, you think?

INT. STATE DEPARTMENT OPERATIONS CENTER - NIGHT

SIX STAPLED PAGES with PHOTOGRAPHS. In the hands of SECRETARY 
OF STATE CYRUS VANCE, 62, a former Navy man who is used to 
telling important people what to do.

VANCE

... this is them? 

(to Hickey)

Explain it to him...

Hickey speaks to a STATE UNDERSECRETARY as we begin to move 
down a line of panicked State Aides.

HICKEY

Six Americans escaped the embassy 
during the takeover. They’re hiding 
at the Canadian Ambassador’s house. 

KERRIGAN

Do they stay put? Do they head for 
the border? Are we attempting 
rescue?

BRICE

Hold for the Secretary --

VANCE

(as he’s handed another 
phone)

-- there’s no one -- hello? 

(into the phone)

This is he ... 

(to an Aide)
(MORE)

VANCE (CONT'D)

Can we get Ottawa patched? That’s 
twice I asked, Jenny --  

10.

Coming back -- on phone -- 

VANCE (CONT’D)

Is White House joining?

INT. WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT

PUSH toward a door that opens and MEN IN SUITS. It’s chaos in 
here. Maps of Iran. The big three plus foreign networks on 
the monitors.

HAMILTON JORDAN, 40s, Carter’s White House Chief of Staff, 
comes into his office. Passing an AIDE who is putting oranges 
into a bowl on his desk as his office becomes a crisis 
center. 

We wish it was the fucking Den of 
Espionage. 

(to Aide; cross)

JORDAN

(to Vance)

Stop giving me fruit. I don’t want 
fruit... C.I. had three people 
there, Lighthouse for the Blind, 
didn’t see a revolution coming --

He’s wearing a sweater and jeans, was pulled from a long 
weekend. A White House foreign policy ANALYST hangs on his 
words. JON TITTERTON, a WASP-y Aide to Jordan, is near.

TITTERTON

The six with the Canadians --

JORDAN

(to Aide)

Bananas count. Bananas are fruit.

He throws the bananas across the room. Now Vance looks to a 
monitor among four, showing footage of a BLINDFOLDED HOSTAGE 
in front of the Embassy. In fact, all the networks are 
showing some variation on this shot.

AIDES everywhere on a staggering array of phones and a cat’s-
cradle of wires.

JORDAN (CONT’D)

Sleeping dogs. We’ve got 60 with 
guns to their heads. 

TITTERTON

-- who are safer than these six at 
this point. Rogue komiteh are out 
hunting, shooting first --

11.

ANALYST

(hanging up a phone)

Bani-Sadr’s saying it’ll be over in 
24 hours.

JORDAN

The six of them are safe for the 
moment. They’re hiding. Let them 
hide.

Hold on black for a breath. Then, the sound of cars.

CUT TO BLACK.

EXT. GEORGE WASHINGTON PARKWAY - MORNING

Yellow ribbons along trees on the George Washington Parkway, 
which connects D.C. to Langley, Virginia. A Lincoln drives 
by.

Super: LANGLEY, VIRGINIA -- 69 DAYS LATER

EXT. PARKING LOT, CIA - MORNING

JACK O'DONNELL, 60s, gets out of his Lincoln and heads toward 
a white building that looks like a college campus. We’re in 
the era of the Old Building of the CIA. Gleaming green glass 
is fifteen years away. 

Jack is Boston Irish, ended up in the Company because he was 
Eisenhower’s bodyguard in France during the War. He’s a 
Second Deputy Chief of Operations.

INT. CIA DIRECTORATE OF OPERATIONS - MORNING

The 1979 CIA headquarters: nothing sleek or sexy about the 
interior either. An open area of desks where Woodward and 
Bernstein might be spilling coffee on their thick 70s ties. 
Papers and files everywhere. Trash emptying happens only once 
a week. Cigarette and cigar butts in ashtrays. Everything is 
perpetually a mess. And typewriters. The constant percussive 
sound of telexes and typing is the metronome that beats out 
the day here.

O’Donnell is passing JOEY SEGUNA, 50s, an analyst.

12.

O'DONNELL

Officer! Gambling on government 
property!

SEGUNA

Packers at Detroit. Put you down?

O'DONNELL

Saturday game, right?

SEGUNA

Saturday.

O'DONNELL

I’m lucky on Saturdays. 

He goes to a small messy KITCHEN AREA to get coffee. On the 
coffeepot somebody’s pinned a note: CHANGE FILTER IF YOU USE! 
DO UNTO OTHERS.

WIDE: A young AIDE comes almost running up to O'Donnell. Says 
something we can’t hear. O'Donnell leaves his styrofoam 
coffee cup steaming and follows the Aide.

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM, LANGLEY - MORNING

O'DONNELL

Ten weeks State’s sitting on this? 

O'Donnell is sitting face to face with HAL SAUNDERS, State 
Department Iran Working Group, late 40s, bloodshot eyes. He 
looks exhausted. He hands O'Donnell pages with STAFF 
PHOTOGRAPHS of SIX PEOPLE. 

SAUNDERS

We got the call the day it went 
down. The six of them went out a 
back exit, Brits turned them away, 
Kiwis turned them away. The 
Canadians took them in. They’ve 
been there since.

O'DONNELL

Black for the moment?

SAUNDERS

For the moment. Trevor says we’ve 
got komiteh with guns going door-to-
door like Jehovah’s Witnesses 
looking for escapees. Executions on 
the spot for any they find. 

A beat while that sinks in.

13.

O'DONNELL

Carter?

SAUNDERS

Shitting enough bricks to build the 
pyramids. He wants them out. We 
want to set a meeting with your 
best exfil guy.

O'DONNELL

What you probably want is my second 
best. Upstairs tends not to like my 
best exfil guy.

SAUNDERS

Why? Who’s your best exfil guy?

INT. O’TOOLE’S BAR - NIGHT

MENDEZ

Now O’Dooley himself was amazed at 
the sight/ Especially to see his 
own wife/ Attempting to steal 
Sergeant Henley’s chapeau/
A woman at her time of life ...

Tony. Who is, at the moment, shitfaced. Singing into a 
microphone on a small stage used for events priced out of the 
Knights of Columbus Hall.

We’re at a retirement party. Balloons and co-workers mixed 
with family. Mendez goes into the crowd and pulls JIMMY  
TOUZANI, 60s, the retiree, who kind of knows the words to the 
song, up from his table. 

MENDEZ & TOUZANI

He soon smelled a rat! To the 
kettle he ran/He sniffed and 
“Begorra!” cried he/ I’ll make it 
bad news for the man who put booze/ 
In the kettle of five o’clock tea!

Applause. Microphone screeches and a couple of the KIDS put 
their fingers in their ears.

MENDEZ

I just, I wanna say to Jimmy... 
we’re gonna miss this sonofabitch. 
I wanna say -- Now this is a... 
This is a great American. 27 years 
this man gave his country, and --

(applause)

And what has got to show for it? 
Look. A trinket with a bird on it. 

He holds up a SILVER CIA MEDAL. The medal engraved with a CIA 
eagle given to retiring officers. Mendez bites it. The crowd 
stirs a little. The fast dive from Amusing Drunk to something 
else begins.

14.

MENDEZ (CONT’D)

Cause they don’t knight men like 
this any more. They knight... where 
is he?  Where’s Engell? Assholes 
like this one...

He points into the crowd. An awkward silence.  ADAM ENGELL, 
40s, prematurely jowly, looks into his beer.

MENDEZ (CONT’D)

There he is. His Majesty the Deputy 
Chief, never did a day in the 
field. Took the Mayflower to Yale, 
his family tree’s a wreath. 

(lifts his drink)

That’s what goes up in our 
organization. Shit floats to the 
top o’the bowl. Me and Jimmy, we...

Touzani puts his arm around Mendez to lead him away.

TOUZANI

C’mon, Tony.

MENDEZ

The mandarins are gone. This is the 
last white tiger, right here. 
You’re the last white tiger, 
sweetheart.

He plants a kiss on Touzani’s cheek. Another couple of guys 
come to help Mendez down.

MENDEZ (CONT’D)

(half sung in an Irish 
brogue)

O’Dooley got rich on an aqueduct 
job and he made a considerable pile 
--

Tony falls, his drink falling out of his hand. Is helped up.

INT. APARTMENT - LATE 

Tony enters his apartment, turns on a light. The place is 
full of unpacked boxes, like he’s recently moved in.

15.

Drunk is giving way to hung-over. He looks at a large 
telephone answering machine. No messages. He thinks. Then 
hits a button on it.

WOMAN’S VOICE

Hi, this is Christine, Tony, and 
Michael. Please leave us a message.

Tony thinks for a moment. Hits REWIND. Then he hits RECORD.

MENDEZ

Hi, this is Tony. Please leave me a 
message.

He hits PLAY.

VOICE OF MENDEZ

Hi, this is Tony. Please leave me a 
message.

He rewinds. Hits RECORD again.

MENDEZ

Hi, this is Tony. Please leave me a 
message.

Rewinds. But now the phone starts to RING. 

INT. LANGLEY, N.E. DIVISION - MORNING

Mendez -- now wide-awake -- and O’Donnell walk fast down a 
hallway. 

The CIA hallways: white concrete with large windows. People 
with laminated badges -- always visible on everyone -- and 
folders with red stripes on them, walk with purpose.

O’DONNELL

Canadian wire traffic calls them 
The Houseguests. They were embassy 
employees. 

O’Donnell hands Mendez files with each of the people he 
mentions. Clipped to the files, their State Department 
photos.

O’DONNELL (CONT’D)

Mark and Cora Lijek.

When he names them, we cut quickly to the Houseguests getting 
their State Department staff photos taken. Getting a better 
look at them than we did at the embassy evacuation...

16.

Mark Lijek, boyish, wearing thick 70s glasses. His wife Cora, 
also wearing glasses: short, pretty, hair pulled back in a 
headband. Camera FLASHES on them.

O’DONNELL (CONT’D)

Joe and Kathy Stafford.

Joe, a high forehead and serious eyes. Kathy, soft features, 
the good-mannered smile of her Southern upbringing. FLASH and  
FLASH.

O’DONNELL (CONT’D)

Lee Schatz.

Lee, Idaho native, thick moustache like the Brawny paper 
towel man. FLASH.

Bob Anders.

O’DONNELL (CONT’D)

Heavy-set. Could be a college professor, maybe one who hits 
on his students. FLASH.

MENDEZ

Are they being hunted?

O’DONNEL

We got Revolutionary Guards combing 
the city for anybody who ever 
looked at an American. Six Yankees 
are the jackpot. 

MENDEZ

Canadian Ambassador’s house?

O’DONNELL

But now the Canadians have had it. 
Foreign secretary thinks if they 
shelter them any longer, they’re 
gonna be next. She cornered Vance 
in Brussels and told him she’s 
serving eviction papers.

MENDEZ

Who else knows they’re there?

Somebody gets into the elevator. The conversation STOPS DEAD.

INT. D.O. FLOOR - HALLWAY

Elevator doors open and the conversation continues.

17.

O'DONNELL

Just the families. Meanwhile, some 
genius in the embassy was keeping a 
mug book of everybody who worked 
there. 

MENDEZ

Jesus Christ.

O'DONNELL

We think it got shredded before 
they got in, but the pricks are re-
assembling the shreds. They’ve got 
carpet-weaver sweatshop kids 
putting Humpty back together again.

(to an Aide)

Hold that! 

(the door; they go 
through)

If the assholes can read OR add, 
any minute they’re gonna figure out 
they’re six short of a full deck. 
They’re gonna make an example of 
anybody who escaped, Tony. Shot on 
sight or standing-room-only for six 
beheadings in the square.

They go into a room where a meeting is beginning at a long 
conference table.

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - A FEW MINUTES LATER

CHUCK COGAN, N.E./South Asia Division Chief, is in charge. At 
the meeting: HENRY DOWNING, 50s, a Directorate of Operations 
officer; and ROBERT PENDER, 40s, from the State Department.

COGAN

Okay?

DOWNING

Bob Pender from State O.S. He’s 
been talking to Morgan and ExtAff. 
Bob.

PENDER

What we like for this are bicycles.

DOWNING

We’ve identified backroads from the 
Shemiran district -- a couple of 
rat lines through the mountains to 
the crossing at Tabriz --

18.

PENDER

Cars are off the table because of 
the roadblocks. So we wait till the 
weather clears up then we deliver 
six bikes and provide maps to the 
Turkish border.

He goes to a map on an easel, indicating the north of Iran.

COGAN

Can they all-- I mean, can they 
ride bikes?

PENDER

We’re prepared to send in somebody  
to teach them.

MENDEZ

Or you can send in training wheels 
and wait at the border with 
Gatorade.

COGAN

Sorry?

People shift in the room.

MENDEZ

It’s 300 miles to the Turkish 
crossings. They’d need six months 
of decathlon training and a support 
crew behind them with a tire pump. 

O'DONNELL

Tony’s an exfil spesh.

Pender and Cole look at each other.

MENDEZ

The only way out’s through the 
airport. You build them new 
identities, a moses goes in and 
takes them out on a commercial 
flight.

DOWNING

They wouldn’t get through airport 
control. Komiteh own the place. The 
six of them have American accents. 

Mendez takes a long pause. Massages the bridge of his nose.

You know what the problem is here? 
Exfils are like abortions. 

MENDEZ

(MORE)

MENDEZ (CONT'D)

You don’t wanna need one, but when 
you do, you don’t do the shit 
yourself. See, what you’re doing is 
bending a clothes-hanger and 
sticking it up your cooch.

19.

INT. OUTSIDE CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

The participants are leaving the meeting. Tony is standing in 
the hall smoking a cigarette. O’Donnell stops at the door, 
looks at Tony, shakes his head, walks on.

INT. MENDEZ APARTMENT - NIGHT

Mendez enters his dark apartment with a bag of Chinese 
takeout. He stands looking at the empty room. For a long 
beat.

INT. MENDEZ HOUSE - NIGHT (CROSS-CUTTING)

MICHAEL MENDEZ, 8 and about to turn 9, is watching a movie on 
the couch. He picks up on the second ring.

MENDEZ (O.S.)

Buddy-man.

MICHAEL

Mom’s asleep.

INT. MENDEZ APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT (CROSS-CUTTING)

Empty cans and Chinese food containers on a coffee table.

MENDEZ

You studying your words?

MICHAEL

Yeah.

But Tony can hear a television soundtrack with ominous 
electronic music.

MENDEZ

What do I hear?

MICHAEL
(coming clean)

Battlestar Galactica. Am I in 
trouble?

A beat.

MENDEZ

What channel?

MICHAEL

Nine.

20.

Mendez turns on his living room television to the three-hour 
BATTLESTAR GALACTICA made-for-tv movie plays. Dirk Benedict 
shoots laser beams at robot soldiers in a canyon landscape.

MENDEZ

Catch me up.

MICHAEL

Okay, so the Cylons are robots, 
right? They were created by these 
reptile people who are extinct 
now...

A HIGH ANGLE on Mendez, asleep, with the phone near his ear, 
a couple more empty cans near him. The last moments of the 
film playing on tv. Mendez half opens his eyes when he hears 
insistent knocking on the front door. 

CUT TO:

MENDEZ

(into the phone)

Michael?

INT. RURAL VIRGINIA HOUSE - NIGHT

Michael, on the couch, also asleep, also with the phone near 
his ear.

INT. MENDEZ APARTMENT - NIGHT

More knocking. Mendez puts the phone on the hook. Opens the 
door. O’Donnell.

O’DONNELL

Two hours I’m getting busy signals.

Mendez gestures for O’Donnell to come inside, but he doesn’t.

O'DONNELL

I asked the Kids to meet you on C 
Street in the morning. You work 
with them on identities and cover 
stories for the airport. Come up 
with something we like and we’ll go 
pitch upstairs. You can run it. If 
you wanna run it.
(MORE)

O'DONNELL (CONT'D)

(then, an afterthought)

It’s gonna take a miracle to get 
them out. And the Ayatollah’s 
outlawed miracles.

21.

O’Donnell turns and walks away. Mendez watches him go.

INT. CANADIAN AMBASSADOR’S RESIDENCE, DINING ROOM - NIGHT

At dinner around a dining room table: the SIX HOUSEGUESTS; 
KEN TAYLOR, 40s, Canadian ambassador. He has salt and pepper 
hair in a 70s permanent, thick glasses, does much to support 
the myth that Canadians are always in a good mood. Next to 
him is PAT TAYLOR, Filipino, 40s, a very good ambassador’s 
wife and an even better doctor or microbiology. We’re joining 
various conversations.

TAYLOR

They say rain but it feels like 
snow to me.

PAT TAYLOR

(to Lee Schatz)

He looked like a cartoon witch 
doctor, everything but the bone 
through his nose, but he gave her  
this herbal stuff... 

Mark Lijek starts to pour wine into Cora Lijek’s glass. She 
puts her hand over the glass.

MARK LIJEK

I forgot.

Joe Stafford, keeping to himself. 

KATHY STAFFORD

(to Joe Stafford)

You ok?

MARK LIJEK

(to Cora Lijek)

Tell him what you said about 
Martin. 

MARK LIJEK (CONT’D)

(then, in Martin’s Noel 
Coward voice)

Mahhr-tin.

CORA LIJEK

I said ... 

CORA LIJEK

You’re terrible. You’re so bad.

(then, to Bob Anders)

(MORE)

CORA LIJEK (CONT'D)

I said he had a personality like a 
case of the clap. And he heard me.

22.

BOB ANDERS

Noooo.

CORA LIJEK

He was coming out of the 
elevator, but it didn’t -- 
that sound it makes, y’know -- 
ding --

BOB ANDERS

It didn’t ding.

CORA LIJEK

It didn’t ding. So I’m going on and 
on, no idea he’s standing there --

The sound of a fork on a glass. Ken Taylor is standing up. 
Holding his wine glass.

TAYLOR

I read today that Tehran was voted 
the second most desirable city in 
the world to live in. Everywhere 
else tied for first.

(he’s good at this)

To getting through ten weeks. To 
our guests.

LEE SCHATZ

(raising his glass)

Our hosts. Mr. Ambassador... 

BOB ANDERS

Hear, hear ...

CORA LIJEK

And Mrs.

But the liquid in their wine glasses is beginning to shake. 
The noise of a HELICOPTER. It’s abrupt and loud.  
Searchlights reflect of the china. The mood changes.

TAYLOR

(trying to still be 
pleasant)

You should get into the crawl 
space.

INT. CIA, O.T.S. DIVISION; FOGGY BOTTOM OFFICES - MORNING

ANGLE - An old black and white TV --

FRANK REYNOLDS

Today, a clear threat to place the 
remaining 50 Americans on trial as 
spies.*

23.

Television cuts to NILOFUR EKTEBAR --- a.k.a., TEHRAN MARY - 
the Penn-educated Tokyo Rose of the hostage crisis, the 
spokeswoman for the hostage-takers. She’s reading a statement 
to the camera. (*America Held Hostage broadcast, ABC News, 
12/8/79) 

In the room: the KIDS. Five analysts with the O.T.S. (Office 
of Technical Services) Division.  MARIO MALINOV, early 30s, 
is Bulgarian and has an accent. Like many of the O.T.S. 
officers of the 70s, he was hired after emigrating from 
behind the Iron Curtain. Malinov is ambitious and speaks with 
the bluntness of Eastern Europe. LAMONT, late 20s, a Master’s 
from the Woodrow Wilson School. ROSSI, SLAVIN, CREELY -- 30s. 

TEHRAN MARY

(on TV, perfect American 
English)

Those who remain here are 
spies and will be treated as 
spies who have interfered 
with the sovereignty of the 
people of Iran.

LAMONT

(watching)

If you’re gonna have a 
propaganda girl, get a cute 
one. She looks like a potato.

Mendez enters the room where the tv sits on a shelf. It’s a 
run-down conference room that’s also the graveyard of a few 
vending machines. These are the oldest CIA offices, former 
OSS campus adjacent to the State Department.

MENDEZ

I’m Mendez. I’m in charge ‘til they 
take their medication upstairs.

INT. CIA, O.T.S. WAR ROOM - AFTERNOON

The Kids function like a group of grad students at MIT trying 
to finish a problem set before the uppers wear off. Mendez is 
the oldest in the room by what feels like 200 years.

MALINOV

Reporters Option again. They issued 
70-something --

SLAVIN

-- visas for American 
journalists.

74.

LAMONT

ROSSI

And the Revolutionary Guards keep 
them on 74 leashes.

Mendez is massaging his forehead.

24.

MENDEZ

They get caught with journalist 
creds, you’ve got Peter Jennings 
with a noose around his neck in an 
hour. 

LAMONT

World Noose Tonight.

MALINOV

(almost singsong)

Again. North American accents 
give us limited options. So 
we get the Canadians to issue 
them passports...

Oh, c’mon, that was funny.

LAMONT

ROSSI

You think they’re gonna leave 
Canadians alone?

MENDEZ

Nobody’s chanting ‘Death to 
Canada.’ More.

MALINOV

They’re Do Gooders.

MENDEZ

More.

MALINOV

Six Canadians who’ve been over 
there inspecting crops in the 
countryside. Making sure the kids 
get enough to eat. Get them creds 
for an agricultural charity --

Malinov pulls from the binder a photograph of an emaciated 
kid in Namibia.

Mendez starts to go through a newspaper on the table. As if 
distracted by something.

MALINOV (CONT’D)

Feed the Children shit -- 
G.A.D. can make binders with 
starving kids --

ROSSI

Are there starving kids in 
Iran? 

LAMONT

These kids are black. These 
are African kids.

SLAVIN

We can get ethnically 
appropriate 
kids.

25.

LAMONT

I’m sure there’s skinny 
kids.. 

MALINOV

A logo with... seeds. “Seeds 
of Hope” ...

Mendez holds a page from the newspaper up to Malinov.

MENDEZ

What do you see in this picture?

A beat. Malinov doesn’t like this, but he’ll play.

MALINOV

Tehran.

MENDEZ

What’s on the ground?

Snow.

MALINOV

MENDEZ

So what crops are the do-gooders 
inspecting under Frosty?

(after a beat of silence)

Let’s graduate from kindergarten.

MALINOV

Okay, three hours in here -- you 
got any ideas? Or you just got 
spitballs.

MENDEZ

I don’t get paid to educate you.

And with that he picks up his stuff and goes. The room is 
silent. 

INT. CIA, CAFETERIA - NIGHT

Tony stands at a vending machine eyeing a 2-tablet pack of 
Excedrin. He puts money in the machine. The Excedrin gets 
stuck halfway down. He bangs on the machine. Hard. Harder. 

INT. FORD BRONCO - NIGHT

Mendez listens to the radio as he drives home along the 
Roosevelt Memorial Bridge, the Washington Monument beyond.

26.

NEWSCASTER (V.O.)

For the first time in  history, the 
White House Christmas tree was 
taken down today after never having 
been lit, as the cruel stalemate in 
Iran continues.

This is a montage that jumps around the world -- scenes of 
our principals and overlapping news accounts compete for 
attention.

INT. MUSHROOM INN - NIGHT

A dark room where most of the 53 AMERICAN HOSTAGES are kept. 
Separated by dividers that keep them in groups of two.

One of the HOSTAGE TAKERS -- a 21 year old with an automatic 
weapon -- plays with his gun.

INT. SMALL TOWN BAR - DAY

News footage of men inside a small-town bar. It’s a broadcast 
of RON MILLER reporting from “barometer community” 
Pecatonica, Illinois, on ABC New’s nightly program, America 
Held Hostage. (*11/21/79)

RON MILLER (V.O.)
So, like the government in 
Washington, the people in 
Pecatonica are grappling for 
solutions.

JACK STROUP, Vietnam vet, red beard, a cap with the Kenworth 
trucks logo, a denim jacket.* (*This, and all t.v. news 
footage in the script, is real and verbatim).

STROUP

Even in our little community here, 
people are drawn up, they’re tight, 
they’re tense.

INT. CANADIAN AMBASSADOR’S RESIDENCE, TEHRAN - NIGHT

CORA LIJEK (OVER)

It IS a word.

Celebratory noises from Bob Anders, one of the other 
Houseguests, as Cora reads from a dictionary.

CORA LIJEK (CONT’D)

“Opposite of postpone. To 
move a date forward in time.”  

MARK LIJEK

Lemme see that. You made that 
up... 

27.

Mark puts his hand over his wife’s mouth in a mock gesture of 
silencing her. She hits him with the dictionary.

ANGLE ON -- A SCRABBLE BOARD and its letters, including the 
word PREPONE, spelled vertically in the middle.

VERY CLOSE ANGLE ON -- More letters.  We’re looking at pile 
of SHREDDED DOCUMENTS -- a hand pieces shreds together to 
form the words: U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE - TEHRAN - 
CLASSIFIED. We’re in a ...

INT. CARPET FACTORY - DAY

Kids at carpet shuttles working with the skill of a 
blindfolded child Mozart at the harpsichord. Beyond them, the 
giant pile of these SHREDDED DOCS where the document 
assembling kids work.

ANGLE  -- CLOSE UP of AYATOLLAH KHOMEINI (Footage from a Mike 
Wallace interview. *60 MINUTES 11/18/79).

As Khomeini speaks, a Translator’s voice is heard over his.

KHOMEINI (FARSI)*

Our young people have taken over 
this nest of corruption. They have 
captured the Americans there. 
America can’t do a damn thing about 
it --

FRANK REYNOLDS (OVER)
They marched again today. They 
march every day.

INT. CANADIAN AMBASSADOR’S RESIDENCE, TEHRAN - NIGHT

PAT TAYLOR

(entering)

Ken saw trucks on Tajik.

The Houseguests stop playing. Mark helps Cora to her feet. 
Kathy Stafford hesitates.

JOE STAFFORD

(to Pat Taylor)

Kathy doesn’t want to go down 
again.

BOB ANDERS

Jesus Christ --

JOE STAFFORD
She’s claustrophobic.

CUT TO:

28.

Back to the ABC News report, the bar in Pecatonica. 

STROUP

I’m like that guy screamin’ in that 
movie-program Network, y’know? I’ve 
had it. And if need be, I’ll bear 
arms again.

ANGLE ON 

MARK LIJEK

You’re putting us all at risk 
--

JOE STAFFORD

They’re not going to come 
into the house.

LEE SCHATZ

Pfffft.

BOB ANDERS

(angry)

Reason with them. Put flowers 
in their gun barrels--

Joe puts his arm around Kathy. But she looks at him, nods, 
then follows the other four Houseguests downstairs. Joe, 
after her.

CUT TO:

A CROWD SCENE in TEHRAN. Then, ABC News anchor Frank Reynolds 
addressing the camera (*11/24/79).

FRANK REYNOLDS

We know you are weary of seeing 
them. So are we.

INT. MENDEZ APARTMENT, KITCHEN - NIGHT

Mendez is watching Frank Reynolds on America Held Hostage on 
a small television in his kitchen, eating Campbell’s soup 
with saltine crackers. On the table, stacks of documents. In 
front of him, a folder with xeroxed photographs of the 
HOUSEGUESTS. 

Mendez changes the channel, switching from Frank Reynolds to 
a local station, where Battle for Planet of the Apes, 
acclaimed as the worst (or maybe second worst) in the series.

ON TV: A desert landscape dotted with technological garbage. 
CAESAR, an ape played by Roddy MacDowell, walks across the 
landscape with two other apes.

Mendez picks up the phone, connected to a long cord, in the 
living room.

INT. RURAL VIRGINIA HOUSE - NIGHT

CHRISTINE MENDEZ, late 30s, doing the dishes, answers. Her 
hair is pulled back. She’s pretty. She’s trying to hold on to 
the cheerful patience she had when she was a first grade 
teacher, but she’s always a bit tired. 

29.

CHRISTINE

MENDEZ (V.O.)

Hello?

Hi.

A beat, then --

CHRISTINE

He’s asleep. He sleeps all day at 
school when you do that.

INT. MENDEZ APARTMENT, KITCHEN - NIGHT (CROSS-CUTTING)

MENDEZ

I missed him.

CHRISTINE 

If you want to see him, see him.

MENDEZ

I miss you.

He’s waiting for a return of the serve, and he has to wait a 
long time.

CHRISTINE

(soft, sad)

(then, quietly, after a 
beat)

I know.

Bye.

She hangs up. Mendez looks at the phone for a moment. Then, 
back up at the movie. Mendez starts to put the phone back but 
stops. He’s staring at the television. 

The Apes walk into the ruins of what was once a great city.

RODDY MACDOWELL (ON TV, AS CAESAR)

This is the hell my forefathers 
used to speak about. (etc).

ON TONY STARING AT THE MOVIE. Wheels turning in his head. 

He picks up the phone and dials a number.

ANGLE

From above, A DEAD BODY in a flophouse hotel -- a bullet hole 
in its head, a puddle of blood around it. A BLIND WOMAN with 
a German Shepherd Guide Dog walks into the shot.

The DOG goes to the dead body and starts to LICK the blood.

A.D. (O.S.)

WE’RE CUTTING!

WIDER reveals that we’re on a ...

INT. WARNER BROTHERS SOUNDSTAGE - NIGHT

A DIRECTOR, 40s, shakes head at an A.D., mid-thirties.

A.D.

(into a walkie)

Anybody got eyes on Chambers?

JOHN CHAMBERS, 57, walking onto set. Overweight, ruddy, a 
hypochondriac. A Chicago guy who spent his childhood in a 
tenement next to the El. Imagine Truman Capote as a straight 
man from the South Side and you’re pretty close. 

CUT TO:

Chambers pops two Maalox into his mouth.

CHAMBERS

I’ll tell you what this is. This is 
Retardo Dog.

Super: BURBANK, CALIFORNIA - JANUARY 19, 1980

CHAMBERS (CONT’D)
No dog who is not a mental 
defective drinks liquid with pepper 
in it. 

Re-pouring the blood. Lacing it with pepper.

CHAMBERS (CONT’D)

(friendly, to the dog)

Yeah? You like that? How bout some 
roach powder?

A.D.

Going again please!

As Chambers walks away --

31.

P.A.

Mr. Chambers, there’s a Tony 
calling for you.

CHAMBERS

Tony who?

P.A.

‘Mendez,’ I think?

Chambers’s face changes from surprised to curious to annoyed.

CHAMBERS

Fuck me.

INT. CIA, CONFERENCE ROOM - MORNING

DOWNING

We’re waiting on Mendez.

Downing, O'Donnell, Creely, Malinov in a conference room. 
O’Donnell looks at the clock.

O’DONNELL

Start without him.

He nods at Malinov.

MALINOV

We’ve put together a Teachers 
Option. It’s possible the airport 
guards won’t know that the 
international schools have been 
shut down, so w--

The door swings open. 

MENDEZ

Hi. Sorry. Hi.

O'DONNELL

(trying to figure out if 
he’s making a scene)

Have a seat, Tony.

He doesn’t.

MENDEZ

They’re a Canadian film crew on a 
location scout for a Hollywood 
movie in Tehran. 

Shift in the room. Mendez is good at making a room 
uncomfortable.

32.

MENDEZ (CONT’D)

Science fiction -- Star Wars, Star 
Trek. They need an exotic place to 
shoot so they’re looking at 
locations around the world. We put 
it out...

MALINOV

(half under his breath)

 -- take our chances with the 
Schwinns --

MENDEZ

-- the Canadian producers put it 
out that they’re looking at Turkey, 
Egypt, whatever -- Then we go to 
the consulate and say we wanna look 
at Iran. I fly in there to meet up 
with the six of them -- and then 
they’ve got a reason to be there. 
We fly out together as a film crew.

MALINOV

(weary)

“In an exfiltration, flamboyant 
cover identities are red-flags, as 
they increase operational 
exposure.” Spy 101  --

MENDEZ

We trained Iranian intelligence. 
The bad guys took Spy 101.

(a beat)

That’s the reason we’re batting 
zip. The cover story to get them 
out has to be as far-fetched as the 
situation that put them there.

O'Donnell looks at Downing.

INT. G.A.D. DIVISION - DAY

Graphics and Authentication branch of the Company. Other 
parts of the organization look down on these guys. Treat them 
as service employees.

Mendez, at a desk, is using an exacto-knife to make 
passports. With a magnifying glass, he actually gets close 
enough to separate a single sheet of paper into its component 
two parts.

O'Donnell comes in. Sits at the end of Mendez’s desk. Mendez 
doesn’t look up. Neither says anything for a long time. Then--

33.

MENDEZ

You’re blocking my light.

O'DONNELL

Downing and I want you to go to 
L.A. 

Mendez looks up.

O'DONNELL (CONT’D)

If you can make the movie thing  
credible, he wants you to pitch it 
to the Director. 

O'Donnell stands to go, then turns back.

O'DONNELL (CONT’D)

I got these people to trust you. 
You fuck this up, it’s not just you 
that goes down. 

INT. T.W.A. FLIGHT - AFTERNOON

Mendez sits in an aisle seat. The PASSENGER next to him is 
looking at the headline of the New York Times: NEW THREATS 
FOR HOSTAGE TRIBUNALS. 

Mendez is reading FILM PRODUCTION HANDBOOK, Second Edition.

INT. MIDDLE-CLASS TEHRAN HOUSE - NIGHT

Six KOMITEH force their way into a house where a WOMAN 
protests. 

KOMITEH SOLDIER

SAVAK! SAVAK!

A Komiteh drags away a MAN in his forties while the man’s 
wife cries. Automatic weapons are aimed at him, point-blank.

INT. CANADIAN AMBASSADOR’S RESIDENCE, DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Pat Taylor helps SHAHEEN, 20s, an Iranian cook/housekeeper, 
clear the table.  Echoing AUTOMATIC WEAPON FIRE in the far 
distance.

SHAHEEN

Your friends from Canada, ma’am. 
All this time. They never go out.

PAT TAYLOR

No. They prefer to stay in.

34.

A significant moment of eye contact.

SHAHEEN

Yes, ma’am.

INT. CANADIAN AMBASSADOR’S RESIDENCE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Lee Schatz and Bob Anders play poker at the kitchen table. 
The gunfire audible here too. Staring at their cards. 

LEE SCHATZ

50 calibur?

BOB ANDERS

Mmm. 50, 35.

INT. CANADIAN AMBASSADOR’S RESIDENCE, KITCHEN - LATER

Kathy Stafford is roughly washing wine glasses at the sink.

JOE STAFFORD

You’ve washed them three times.

He puts his arm on her shoulder. She ignores his arm. Keeps 
scrubbing. 

INT. CANADIAN AMBASSADOR’S RESIDENCE, BATHROOM - NIGHT

Ken Taylor is brushing his teeth in the mirror. Pat comes in, 
closes the door. 

PAT TAYLOR

Shaheen knows.

INT. CANADIAN AMBASSADOR’S RESIDENCE, BEDROOM - NIGHT

Mark and Cora lie in bed in an upstairs bedroom. Another 
ROUND OF FIRE. Mark puts his arms around Cora. Nudges his 
face close to hers.

MARK LIJEK

It’s far away.

CORA LIJEK

It’s closer.

INT. CHAMBERS’S STUDIO, WB LOT - DAY

Stunt double-masks, deformed monster foreheads, dental 
implants on shelves. Planet of the Apes prosthetics. 

35.

Mr. Spock ears on styrofoam stands. (Chambers created all 
these -- really).

CHAMBERS

They don’t open windows in here, 
you get tuberculosis --

There are busts with prosthetics of women’s breasts hanging 
off them near the door. As Chambers turns on lights, he names 
each.

CHAMBERS (CONT’D)

Candace Bergen and Tuesday Weld.

MENDEZ

Why do you have their tits?

CHAMBERS

Prosthetics to make them look like 
tits.

(pointing to another set)

Elizabeth Taylor. Her tits face 
apart like they just had a big 
fight with each other. 

Chambers closes the door. 

MENDEZ

It’s an exfil. 

CHAMBERS

From where?

MENDEZ

Worst place you can think of.

CHAMBERS

Florida?

Mendez picks up a TIME Magazine under a can of Tab on a make-
up table. It’s the November 19, 1979 issue, with blindfolded 
Iran hostages on the cover. Chambers takes it in for a 
moment, then --

CHAMBERS (CONT’D)

How you getting in the embassy?

MENDEZ

Not the hostages. Six got away and 
are hiding in the city. I’m going 
over to get them.

CHAMBERS

What are the disguises? 

36.

MENDEZ

No disguises.

A beat.

CHAMBERS

Okay, me simple island girl, no 
understand. If there are no 
disguises, why do you need me?

INT. RAINBOW PANDA CHINESE RESTAURANT - DAY

We slowly move closer to Mendez and Chambers sit in a booth. 
Chambers is looking at PHOTOGRAPHS of the SIX. Mendez is 
taking notes. On a photo of Cora Lijek.

CHAMBERS

This one’s got an M.A. in English. 
He should be your screenwriter. 
Sometimes they go on scouts cause 
they want the free meals.

(another photograph; Bob 
Anders)

This guy’s the director.

MENDEZ

Can you teach a guy how to be a 
director in a day?

CHAMBERS

You can teach a rhesus monkey how 
to be a director in a day. 
(re: something on his 
fork)

What does this look like to you? 
These waiters are V.C. They’re 
trying to kill me.

(scrapes it off)

Look, if you’re gonna do it, you’ve 
got to do it.

(to Chinese Waiter)

Can you take this away? I don’t 
even... animal, vegetable, or 
mineral here...

(Waiter takes plate; back 
to Tony)

The Khomaniacs are crazy but 
they’re not stupid. They have 
phones. They have relatives who 
live here. You can’t build cover 
stories around a movie that doesn’t 
exist. You need a script. You need 
a producer.

37.

MENDEZ
I’m the producer.

CHAMBERS

Associate producer. At best. If 
it’s a twenty-million dollar Star 
Wars rip-off, you need somebody 
who’s a somebody to put his name on 
it. 

The waiter brings fortune cookies.

CHAMBERS (CONT’D)

Somebody respectable. With credits. 
Who we can trust with classified 
information. Who’ll produce a fake 
movie. For free. 

INT. BEVERLY HILLS - EVENING

They walk up the driveway of a more modest version of the 
DeMille House.

CHAMBERS

You don’t talk. I talk. 

A Mexican Housekeeper answers the door of a house with white 
columns. A scotch terrier watches.

SIEGEL (O.S.)

Yeah, come in.

INT. SIEGEL HOUSE, HALLWAY - EVENING

And there’s LESTER SIEGEL, a semi-legendary producer in his 
semi-legendary seventies. He’s equal parts bookie and rabbi. 
His father sold perfume on the Lower East Side. Lester is 
halfway to dressed in a tuxedo.

SIEGEL

(shakes hands)

I only got a couple minutes. I’m 
getting an award from A.F.I. 
tonight.

CHAMBERS

Mazeltov, Lester.

Aaah, I’d rather stay home and 
count the wrinkles on my dog’s 
balls.

It has become, in some respects, an 
international media carnival.*

The broadcast cuts to: a JAPANESE REPORTER, then a BRITISH 
one. Standing in front of the Embassy in a sea of cameras. 
(*ABC News, 12/20/79).

SIEGEL (O.S.)

A little experiment. You be me 
hearing you.

INT. SIEGEL’S DEN - EVENING

The t.v. we’re watching sits in a room with a couple of 
Golden Globes and pictures of a younger Lester with Billy 
Wilder in Palm Springs with their thumbs turned up like 
hitchhikers. 

Siegel is smoking a cigar. He turns down the volume.

SIEGEL

Six people in the middle of a city 
of, what, four million --

ON TV, a wild-eyed woman in the crowd (*in one of the most 
widely-played clips of the hostage crisis) makes an ax-
falling gesture with her arm repeatedly.

SIEGEL (CONT’D)

-- who chant “Death to America” all 
the livelong day. You wanna set up 
a picture in a week. Lie to a whole 
town of people who lie to people 
for a living. And Iranian 
intelligence. Have Double-O Seven 
here sneak into a country that 
wants CIA blood with their 
breakfast cereal. Then walk six 
white faces out of the most watched 
city in the world...

39.

MENDEZ

... past a hundred Revolutionary 
Guards with Kalashes at the 
airport. 

SIEGEL

Look, I wanna help you, but... You 
know what our rule was in OSS.? You 
don’t even think about a covert op 
if there’s even a chance of 
failure. So lemme hit it again for 
the cheap seats: NO. You both 
belong in Cedars-Sinai, on the 
floor that don’t allow shoelaces.

Chambers gives Mendez a look and gestures for Mendez to walk 
out with him.

CHAMBERS

(to Lester, as he gets up)
Enjoy your fish dinner tonight.

Chambers stops at the muted television. More images of angry 
crowds. 

CHAMBERS (CONT’D)

You ever think, Lester, how it’s 
all for the cameras?

Then the following builds as a crescendo of duelling pianos.

CHAMBERS (CONT’D)

It’s all moving pictures. They’re 
telling a story for the cameras and 
the whole world is watching it. You 
invented this shit, Lester.

SIEGEL

You’re goddamn right I did --

CHAMBERS

They’re making the movie, Lester.

SIEGEL

 -- pioneered this shit, I was 
Lewis AND Clark out here --

They’re making the movie.

CHAMBERS

SIEGEL

-- trading beads with 
savages!

A beat of silence. ON Mendez. Who are these men?

40.

SIEGEL (CONT’D)

C’mon, willya?! You think I can be 
manipulated that easy? 

Siegel looks at the TV: at that moment, an image from the 
same ABC broadcast -- a HOSTAGE TAKER in a cardigan sweater 
holding up black and white photos of hostages for the SEA OF 
CAMERAS in front of him.

CHAMBERS (V.O.)

How bout “The Horses of Achilles”?

INT. SIEGEL’S HOUSE - MORNING

Lester’s new A.F.I. award sits under a spiked glass of 
Tropicana a coaster. Stacks of scripts on the table. 
Meanwhile, Chambers, on the hold on the phone, holds up the 
‘Horses of Achilles’ script in a William Morris binder. 

SIEGEL

(moving stacks of scripts)
Nobody makes Westerns any more.

CHAMBERS

(looking through it)

Ancient Troy.

SIEGEL

If it’s got “horses” in the title, 
it’s a Western. 

A MEXICAN MAID mouths “Lunch” to Lester and he nods.

CHAMBERS

(then, into the phone)

Hi, yeah, I’m calling about your ad 
in Variety -- the office space --

INT. SIEGEL’S LIVING ROOM - DAY

Mendez, on the phone near a fully stocked bar that may have a 
couple of Emmy Awards on it. 

O'DONNELL (O.S.)

The Cardinal wants all cover 
options on his desk Friday morning. 

INT. O’DONNELL’S OFFICE - DAY (CROSS-CUTTING)

They’re prepping the Bikes Option 
and the Teachers Option. 

O'DONNELL

(MORE)

O'DONNELL (CONT'D)

You’ve got 72 hours to make yours 
better... You there? 

41.

Mendez is looking down at the SCRIPT in front of him. He 
opens to the first page. ANGLE on him reading, thinking.

ODONNELL (O.S.)

Tony?

EXT. LESTER’S POOL - DAY

Mendez walks up to the table where Siegel and Chambers are 
already eating.

SIEGEL

(giving Chambers a 
mozzarella ball)

These are good. These come from a 
little place in New York.

MENDEZ

(entering, reading)

“Fade in on... An arch with a 
starship in bas-relief. We’re in a 
temple. An exotic, Middle Eastern, 
vibe. Women dressed in the colors 
of their planetary tribes offer 
ecstatic libations to the sky 
gods.” 

SIEGEL

Ecstatic whats?

Mendez throws down the script. Chambers reads the cover.

CHAMBERS

“ARGO. A science-fantasy adventure 
by Timothy Harris.”

SIEGEL

(taking the script)

I know this script. It’s in 
turnaround. You wanna set it up, I 
can have the option by tomorrow.

MENDEZ

Why do we need the option?

SIEGEL

You’re worried about the mullahs? 
Try the WGA. They’ll shut you down 
before you’ve set it up. 

(reading)

Mr. Timothy Harris. 

Siegel picks up a huge cordless phone from the table. Starts 
to dial the number on the front of the script.

42.

CHAMBERS

You think it’s available?

SIEGEL

It’s available. I’ve read it. It’s 
shit on a soda-cracker.

INT. TOPANGA HOUSE - DAY

SIEGEL

It’s a masterpiece.

Siegel, carrying the ARGO script. TIMOTHY HARRIS, 40s, a 
rolled cigarette in his hand (or a joint) leads Lester, 
Chambers, and Mendez into his house. The house:  picture of 
the Maharishi with the Beatles, a Balinese drum. Harris 
himself: still on a drug trip that started in the summer of 
‘69. An IRISH WOLFHOUND, about as big as a Clydesdale, 
follows, barking.

HARRIS

(to dog)

GRENDEL, SHUT IT!

(to the others)

Well I’m not gonna say the name, 
but believe me, you’d -- you’ve 
seen his movies, so. Six months 
this goes on, and finally I had it, 
I said, ‘Do I tell you how to 
direct? Do I tell the D.P. where to 
put the lights? How come everybody 
thinks they can give notes to the 
writer?’

SIEGEL

Awful business. Awful.

HARRIS

He says to me, ‘If you don’t wanna 
take notes, go home and write 
poetry and stick it in a drawer, 
Miss Emily Fucking Dickinson.’

MENDEZ

We love the script as is.

HARRIS
(to the dog)
GRENDEL, DROP IT!

(to Mendez)

Hmmm?

43.

SIEGEL

My mother’s grave. We won’t change 
a word.

Harris takes a drag. Looks at them. Then he motions for the 
option agreement from Siegel. Flips through.

HARRIS

I don’t have my glasses. You gotta 
show me where to sign.

INT. PRODUCTION OFFICE, COLUMBIA LOT, SUNSET & GOWER - DAY

DOUG, a Maintenance Man in his 60s, black, soft-spoken, 
showing them the office. Someone in his taking down signs: 
PRODUCTION OFFICE - THE CHINA SYNDROME.

DOUG

This was his chair right here -- 
Michael Douglas’s ass. This chair. 
One week ago. I sweartagod.

CHAMBERS
What about phones?

DOUG

Already hooked up. ‘Move-in-ready’ 
means ‘move-in-ready.’ 

MENDEZ

Sold.

INT. ARGO PRODUCTION OFFICE, TONY’S OFFICE - DUSK

Mendez puts the Argo script on a desk and looks around the 
empty office. Deep breath. Siegel pokes his head in.

Okay?

SIEGEL

INT. LESTER’S MERCEDES - NIGHT

Lester drives Mendez back to his hotel. 

MENDEZ

You got kids, Lester?

SIEGEL

Two daughters. I talk to them once 
a year, maybe.

MENDEZ

Why’s that?

44.

SIEGEL

When they were growing up, my fuck-
ups were spectacular, both in 
number and quality. 

(beat while he drives)

The bullshit business is like coal 
mining. You forget to wash it off 
before you kiss your wife and 
kids... You?

MENDEZ

A son. He’s staying out in the 
country with his mother and his 
grandmother. 

SIEGEL
You’re divorced?

MENDEZ
Taking time off. 
(then, quiet)

He loves the woods out there. He 
named every tree.

ANGLE ON 

A POSTER. It’s a space-scape that reads: Studio Six 
Productions presents: ARGO. A COSMIC WAR. We’re in the ...

INT. PRODUCTION OFFICE - DAY

Mendez and a Graphics Artist are looking at it on his desk. A 
phone rings.

MENDEZ

“War” sounds like Star Wars. Let’s 
use a different word.

Graphics Artist nods.

WIDER reveals that the production office is being set up. A 
couple of FURNITURE GUYS move chairs in. 

Chambers holds up a telephone to Mendez.

MENDEZ (CONT’D)

(to Chambers)

I’ll take it in there.

Mendez goes into a private office, holding the poster.

45.

O’DONNELL (V.O.)

They caught one of the shah’s 
enforcers two steps from an Air 
France plane, trying to get to 
Paris. 

INT. O’DONNELL’S OFFICE - DAY

O’Donnell reads from the EYES ONLY document.

O'DONNELL 

Quote -- “Since the incident, the 
number of komiteh at the airport 
appears to have doubled. Background 
examinations of both nationals and 
foreigners should be expected.” No 
cover’s gonna stand up to that 
shit, Tony.

INT. ARGO PRODUCTION OFFICE - DAY (CROSS-CUTTING)

Mendez, on phone - 

MENDEZ

Stall the Cardinal. Get me more 
time.

Siegel, meanwhile, has entered Mendez’s office. Mendez hangs 
up, sits in his chair looking at the Argo poster, the script. 

MENDEZ (CONT’D)

It’s not enough.

Siegel picks up the Argo poster.

SIEGEL

I’ll tell you the lesson you learn 
when you’ve got an ingenue with a 
drug problem. You need to sell a 
lie, you get the press to sell it 
for you.

INT. ARGO PRODUCTION OFFICE - MORNING

Noisy in here now -- ASSISTANTS and controlled chaos --  

SIEGEL

(on the phone)

Crystal Ballroom, press event and 
reading... No, I promised Variety 
exclusive on that one ...

Mendez is making a list with a PUBLICIST.

MENDEZ

The Reporter, the Times, agents, 
managers... “Biggest Canadian 
production in history.” 

46.

PUBLICIST

(getting into it)

Canadian ‘Gone With the Wind.’ 

MENDEZ

Canadian Sci-Fi Gone With the Wind.

SIEGEL

I think I got us a --

Chambers, on the phone, hands Lester a written message slip. 

SIEGEL (CONT’D)

I DID get us a storyboard artist 
who draws for D.C. Comics. He’ll 
send some stuff today.

CHAMBERS
(on the phone)

I gotta let you know tomorrow, 
Phil. I can’t get my own mother a 
ticket, I’ve had her crying into 
the phone... Okay ...

Chambers hangs up.

MENDEZ

Why are you turning people away?

CHAMBERS

You know what gets more suckers 
than a sign that says “Brooklyn 
Bridge For Sale”? A sign that says, 
“Brooklyn Bridge For Sale: Approved 
Buyers Only.”

Publicist walks in and puts down a newly-delivered copy of 
VARIETY.  Mendez flips through Variety and stops on a full-
page ad, modeled around an explosion in space. (*This is real 
- Variety): STUDIO SIX PRODUCTIONS PRESENTS: ARGO: A COSMIC 
CONFLAGRATION.

MENDEZ
(to himself)

Conflagration.

It’s not a bad word. 

47.

INT. O’DONNELL’S OFFICE - DAY

O’Donnell sits down at his desk, reads a memo lying there. 
From the look on his face, it is bad news.

INT. TONY’S HOTEL ROOM - EVENING

Mendez, shirtless, wearing a towel, fresh out of the shower.

MENDEZ
Why’d they do it?

INT. O'DONNELL’S OFFICE - AFTERNOON

O'DONNELL

They did it cause they did it. They  
don’t need a reason. They’re going 
with the bikes.

MENDEZ

It’s a death sentence.

ODONNELL

Well then it’s on them. Wash your 
hands.

MENDEZ

Are they out to help these people 
or are they out to fuck me?

O'DONNELL

They did fuck you. When they cut 
off the money that means they 
fucked you.

MENDEZ

You came to me.

I’m making it work. You came to me.

(then, again, quietly)

O'Donnell, slumping in his chair.

A KNOCK on Mendez’s hotel door.

MENDEZ (CONT’D)

I’m going to continue to assume 
money will be there. Because I will 
assume you will find the money. 

Mendez opens the door. A HOTEL VALET is holding a large 
folder wrapped in brown paper. Mendez grabs at his pants for 
a dollar. 

48.

MENDEZ (CONT’D)

(to Valet)

Thank you.

(closes the door)

Because I will make this work. You 
hear me, Jack? I will make this 
work.

Mendez tears open the brown paper and holds up a large COMIC 
PANEL - a woman in an elaborate anthropoligcal-tech outfit on 
a desert planet. A label reads: ARGO CONCEPT DRAWINGS.

ANGLE -- Moving over the storyboard drawings. Half a dozen 
renderings of a fantastical ARGO comic-book world. A 
MARKETPLACE selling spices exotic-looking vegetables; a Ben-
Hur chariot race with airborne vehicles; etc.

CUT TO:

MENDEZ (O.S.) (CONT’D)

What’s happening now?

MICHAEL (O.S.)

Just turn on the tv.

MENDEZ (O.S.)

It’s not the same channels where I 
am. You have to tell.

INT. TONY’S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Mendez is lying on his bed, the storyboard drawings spread 
around the room, a phone near his ear.

MICHAEL (V.O.)

So the guy from NASA saw the 
metorite that brought the spiders 
with it.

INT. RURAL VIRGINIA HOUSE - NIGHT

Michael is watching 1975 B-movie ‘Giant Spider Invasion’ on 
television. A Wisconsin town is being ransacked by a 
fiberglass spider the size of a U-Haul, and now the rednecks 
have had enough.

MICHAEL

So he measured the gamma rays 
at the crash site and figured 
out they must be from an 
interdimensional gateway.

SHERIFF

(into walkie, on t.v.)

I’m down here all by myself! 
They’re hell-bent on 
destroying that beast! Call 
the National Guard back...

49.

MENDEZ

What’s that? Like a black hole?

MICHAEL

I think so, yeah. A black hole.

ANGLE - Christine, sitting on the floor in the hallway, 
listening.

INT. G.A.D. - DAY

O’Donnell, standing over a desk where a GRAPHICS SPECIALIST 
works, not far from Tony’s desk.

ODONNELL

You’re back in business.

INT.  ARGO PRODUCTION OFFICE - MORNING

MENDEZ 

How’d you do it?

O'DONNELL

A tribe of Karubo Indians in the 
Amazon aren’t getting their cash to 
resist Communist influence. I’m 
putting their money in your 
account.

MENDEZ

(on the phone)

You’re a great American, Jack.

O'DONNELL (V.O.)

I haven’t told you the bad news. 
The Canadians will only give us 
fake passports for the Houseguests. 
Not for you.

INT. G.A.D. - DAY

O'DONNELL
(reading a memo)

“Documents will be provided only on 
humanitarian grounds. Not for use 
by intelligence professionals.” 

MENDEZ

So get me a different passport.

O’Donnell picks up the passport that a Graphics Specialist is 
working on. 

50.

O'DONNELL

Yeah, well. We looked at your alias 
and did what we could do.

The passport: REPUBLIC OF IRELAND.

INT. ARGO PRODUCTION OFFICE - MORNING

Mendez, dressed in a shirt and tie, stands front of a mirror.

MENDEZ

Hiii, how are youu. Yeeaouuuu. How 
arrr yeaouuu? Jaysus. 

Siegel and Chambers, dressed similarly, nearby.

SIEGEL
(to Chambers)

Did he have a stroke?

CHAMBERS

(to Mendez)

Kevin. How about you’re an Irish 
national who was raised in Canada?

MENDEZ

(normal accent again)

Yeah, I think I was raised in 
Candada.

CHAMBERS

I think so.

EXT./INT. BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - MORNING

A black sedan pulls up to the hotel. A Driver opens the back 
door. Mendez, Siegel, and Chambers get out of the car. 
They’re wearing dark business suits and sunglasses.

They walk past a sign that reads: -- PRESS EVENT and READING 
FOR ‘ARGO’ -- REGISTER IN LOBBY.  A couple of posters with 
the explosion-in-space ARGO: A COSMIC CONFLAGRATION logo.

IN THE LOBBY - The three standing in front of the double 
doors to the Crystal Ballroom. 

Mendez opens the door, the noise floods out, and we follow 
the three into ...

INT. CRYSTAL BALLROOM, BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - MORNING

Storyboard drawings throughout the room. Four or five ACTORS 
IN SCI-FI COSTUMES. 

Camera flashes. Publicist immediately goes to Mendez and his 
two producers.

51.

PUBLICIST

Janet from the Times -- You know 
Johnny Chambers and Lester Siegel. 
This is Kevin Harkins. He’ll tell 
you a bit about the film --

We leave Mendez with the L.A. Times -- following Siegel --

WOMAN (O.S.)

Lester.

He turns around. NINA, a woman in her early sixties, made up 
to look younger.

SIEGEL

Nina. You’re gorgeous. You’re in 
the reading?

NINA

I’m playing Serksi the Ancient 
Galactic Witch.

Catching Chambers, who has been grabbed by JASON TROOB, an 
agent --

TROOB

-- and she’s got chops, she’s 
Juilliard, same as Meryl --

CHAMBERS

I think Meryl was Yale --

Siegel, passing Chambers.

SIEGEL

Keep that fucking galactic witch 
away from me.

CHAMBERS

You know her?

SIEGEL

I was married to her.

Publicist guiding Mendez toward an anemic-looking man --

52.

PUBLICIST

(to Mendez, introducing)

Rodd from Variety. Kevin Costa 
Harkins.

Now following Mendez and Rodd, who has a reporter’s pad. 
Publicist hands Mendez a LASER GUN and a Photographer snaps 
his picture. Siegel walks by, downing one from the bar.

SIEGEL

-- Serksi the Ancient Galactic 
Bitch --

CHAMBERS
(to a reporter)

...the ship that Jason used to 
rescue the Golden Fleece from the 
dragon, the ‘Argo’ --

Picking up Nina, who is talking to an attractive young Actor.

NINA

-- Awake and Sing together at the 
Group. Back when Lester had self-
respect --

MENDEZ

(to Rodd)

Irish films, mostly. You Irish?

(Rodd shakes his head)

Big releases over there.

SIEGEL

Clurman, Kazan -- she fucked 
Tennessee Williams for 
Christ’s sake --

PUBLICIST

Let’s all take our places for 
the reading, please! We’re 
starting the reading!

RODD
(to Mendez)

You said shooting in Iran? You ever 
watch the news?

Nina is walking arm-in-arm to the table with the Young Actor. 
She looks at one of the Droids, who waves to her.

NINA

You wanna know something about this 
business? Art has lost. In a 
landslide. Wasn’t even close. 

And we settle on MENDEZ. He takes a glass of wine from a 
passing waiter’s tray, downs it, and puts it on another 
WAITER’S tray. We follow that Waiter through a swinging door, 
into the Kitchen and Prep area, where a small black and white 
t.v. plays ...

53.

ARCHIVE FOOTAGE -- Tehran Mary speaks into a microphone.

TEHRAN MARY (ON T.V.)

As the Imam Khomeini said, we have 
found no evidence that proves that 
these people are diplomats.

INT. O'DONNELL’S OFFICE - DAY

O’Donnell, watching the same footage on the News at Noon. 

TEHRAN MARY (ON T.V.)
All evidence proves that these 
people are spies.

The ARRAY OF VIDEO CAMERAS on tripods recording her.

NINA (V.O.)

(as Serksi)

This man you call a hero is a death-
bringer. Mirror-bright stars tell 
truth, and clouds are coming. 

INT. BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL, CRYSTAL BALLROOM - MORNING

The reading of Argo is happening around a table.

NINA

This Daughter of Light is a fool to 
believe the fire of hope yet burns.

INT. AROUND THE CANADIAN AMBASSADOR’S RESIDENCE, TEHRAN - DAY

MARK LIJEK (OVER)

-- fifty-seven -- fifty-eight --

Mark counts out as Lee Schatz does push ups. Bob Anders 
watches a television in the background, subtitled in Farsi.

JIMMY CARTER (ON T.V.)

We will not yield to international  
terror or to blackmail.

INT. MUSHROOM INN, AMERICAN EMBASSY, TEHRAN - MORNING

Five of the EMBASSY HOSTAGES -- men from their 20s to their 
50s -- are roused from their sleeping mats by Komiteh. Hoods 
are put over their heads.

ACTRESS (V.O.)

(as Queen Aleppa)

One hope. And that is the man who 
left this place long ago.

54.

EXT. AMERICAN EMBASSY, TEHRAN - MORNING

A handmade sign that reads: CIA PENTAGON UNCLE SAM - VIETNAM 
WOUNDED YOU - IRAN WILL BURY YOU. The usual crowds of 
PROTESTORS outside the gates.

PROTESTORS

Magbar Cartar! Magbar Ahmrika!

TEHRAN MARY

We will begin the trials and will 
carry out the sentences.

This MONTAGE should give some sense of the chaos, the 
theatrical chaos, in Iran, and of the waves of that chaos 
spreading 7000 miles away to the U.S. Voice upon voice, image 
upon image, landing on television sets.

INT. BASEMENT, AMERICAN EMBASSY, TEHRAN - MORNING

The four hostages, hoods on their heads, placed against the 
wall. HOSTAGE TAKERS raise their guns at the men.

GREEN JACKET (FARSI)

Fire!

ACTRESS (V.O.)

If we find his ship, we will 
find him. Aboard the Argo 
lies my hope. My hero. My 
husband.

They pull their triggers. But nothing happens. It’s a mock 
execution (actually occurred -- February 5, 1980). The five 
hostages, after a beat, either scream or take deep breaths or 
collapse.

EXT.  CANADIAN AMBASSADOR’S RESIDENCE - NIGHT

MARK LIJEK

A hundred and twelve -- 

Lee Schatz collapses from his push-ups. Breathing heavily. 

MARK LIJEK (CONT’D)

And we have a new champion.

Bob Anders looks up from Jimmy Carter, who keeps talking in 
the background, and applauds.

SHAHEEN quietly cleans a table. She’s watching the 
Houseguests. 

55.

MENDEZ (O.S.)

(reading stage directions)

Crane down over the battlefield and 
hold there ...

INT. BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - DAY

Mendez, at the table, flanked by Siegel and Chambers.

MENDEZ

from the ruins of the starship in 
the desert sands. Fade to black. 
The End.

INT. TONY’S HOTEL ROOM - LATE 

Mendez, Siegel, Chambers in their clothes from the press 
event.  They’re lying on the floor. A pizza box and a couple 
of open beers near them. Hold for a long time without anyone 
saying anything.

MENDEZ

Knock knock.

No one responds.

MENDEZ (CONT’D)

Knock knock.

CHAMBERS

Who’s there?

Argo.

Argo who?

MENDEZ

CHAMBERS

MENDEZ

Argo fuck yourself.

A beat, then peals of laughter. They’re exhausted. This 
counts for hilarious. 

INT. O'DONNELL’S OFFICE - EARLY MORNING

NATHAN COX, 28, intercepts O'Donnell coming back from the 
coffee machine. Cox has rehearsed this confrontation for the 
last seven minutes.

56.

COX

I just hung up with a Brazil 
station chief having a seizure. The 
money for his Amazon project went 
missing. 

O'DONNELL

(not stopping)

I borrowed it.

COX

That’s the Karubo money. We’ve got 
Marxist guerillas 500 miles away. 
We made a deal with their chief --

O'DONNELL

They’re a Stone Age tribe, Nathan.  
They don’t know what money is. You 
give them money, they try to eat 
it. 

O'Donnell goes off with his coffee and cheese danish. 

Waiting in front of O’Donnell’s office is ENGELL. His arms 
are folded. He’s O’Donnell’s boss, and he’s not happy.

O’DONNELL

Yessir, can I help you?

INT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE HOTEL, LOBBY - MORNING

A display of newspapers and trade dailies on a table near a 
breakfast buffet. Mendez picks up the Hollywood Reporter.

‘ARGO’ TO BEGIN SHOOTING IN MARCH. Oscar-winner Chambers,

the press event. He heads out.

INT. RURAL VIRGINIA HOUSE - DAY

CHRISTINE

Hello?

INT. ARGO PRODUCTION OFFICE - DAY

Mendez holds the Hollywood Reporter with his picture as Kevin 
Harkins.

MENDEZ

Good morning.

CHRISTINE

You sound good.

MENDEZ

I am.

(simply and meaning it)

I think I’m doing something good.

A beat. She softens.

CHRISTINE

We’re gonna have his birthday party 
at a bowling alley. You should 
come.

MENDEZ

I’m gonna try.

CHRISTINE

Try. 

(listen I-gotta-go)

My mother’s driving us to school. 
She’s got the snow-tires, so.

MENDEZ

Okay, yeah.

CHRISTINE

Try, though.

Another line starts ringing. Christine hangs up and Mendez 
picks up the second line.

MENDEZ

O’DONNELL

Yeah.

It’s me.

MENDEZ

Go buy the Hollywood trades, Jack.

INT. CIA, LANGLEY - DAY (CROSS-CUTTING)

O'DONNELL  (VOICE)

It hit the fan. You gotta come 
back.

And hold on Tony, looking out the window at the backlot.

58.

INT. ARGO PRODUCTION OFFICE - MORNING

While Tony packs a bag of papers from his desk. 

SIEGEL

I made thirty pictures and every 
one of them got shut down by pricks 
in the upstairs office at least 
once. You always gotta go around 
them.

Mendez finishes packing, zips up the bag.

SIEGEL (CONT’D)

I’ll tellya one thing -- my ass is 
staying right here and running a 
movie company. 

Siegel takes a bottle of Jack and three shot glasses from a 
drawer. 

SIEGEL (CONT’D)

(pours)

Fort Sumter. The first shot of the 
picture. 

Chambers holds up his glass.

CHAMBERS
Argo fuck yourself.

They raise to that. They each do a shot. Then Tony picks up 
his bag and heads out. Before he goes --

MENDEZ

Lester. How’d you always get around 
the pricks upstairs?

SIEGEL

I went over their heads. You can 
always find another prick one floor 
higher up.

59.

EXT. CIA, LANGLEY - DAY

To establish. The sound of footsteps --

INT. CIA, LANGLEY - DAY

Down a hallway. Mendez, coming from an adjacent hallway, 
putting on a tie, joins O’Donnell hurrying through the 
building.

O’DONNELL

How’d you get the meeting?

MENDEZ

I pissed off the guys who sign my 
check and yours. 

O’DONNELL

I oughta slit your throat.

MENDEZ

You can forget about buying the 
time-share in Ocean City, for 
starters.

INT. STATE DEPARTMENT, SEVENTH FLOOR; RECEPTION ROOM - DAY

CIA DIRECTOR ADMIRAL STANSFIELD TURNER, 50s, and SECRETARY OF 
STATE CYRUS VANCE walk down the hall together, discussing 
something in hushed tones.

O'DONNELL

(under his breath)

Brace yourself. It’s like talking 
to those two old fucks on The 
Muppets.

You watch The Muppets.

MENDEZ

O'DONNELL

Don’t be a moron. Everybody watches 
The Muppets.

Vance and Turner enter the room. Mendez and O’Donnell stand 
up.

ANGLE - A concept drawing from Argo. 

TURNER (O.S.)

Aliens and robots.

MENDEZ (O.S.)

Yes sir.

60.

INT. STATE DEPARTMENT, SEVENTH FLOOR - DAY

ADMIRAL STANSFIELD TURNER, 50s, Director of Central 
Intelligence and not the most popular man ever to hold that 
office, is looking at the storyboard.

TURNER

You’re telling me there’s a movie  
office in Hollywood right now 
that’s funded by the Central 
Intelligence Agency.

MENDEZ

Yes sir.

VANCE

What’s wrong with the bikes again?

... you think this -- 

TURNER

O'DONNELL

We tried to get the message 
upstairs --

TURNER

-- you think this is more plausible 
than teachers?

O'DONNELL

One, there are no foreign teachers 
in Iran any more. Two, we think 
everybody knows Hollywood people. 
And everybody thinks they would 
shoot during Stalingrad with Pol 
Pot directing if it’d sell tickets.

Turner and Vance look at each other.

TURNER

Run it by me again.

INT. D.C. BAR - NIGHT

ANGLE - Mike Wallace speaks with the Ayatollah Khomeini. 
Wallace: deferential but he has just enough asshole in his 
voice to indicate he’s an important old man, too.

MIKE WALLACE

What can be the answer?*

A Translator conveys this to Khomeini; Khomeini speaks. A 
clock says it’s getting late. 

Mendez is watching half-watching a t.v. above the bar. (*60 
Minutes, first broadcast 11/18/79).

61.

KHOMEINI/TRANSLATOR

He’s not even going to listen.*

O'DONNELL (O.S.)

Scotch, any kind.

O'Donnell sits next to Tony and puts a FOLDER.

O'DONNELL (CONT’D)

They want you to take them through 
the airport in three days. You get 
your visa with your Irish passport 
in Bonn.

O'Donnell pulls from the folder a Lufthansa ticket.

MENDEZ

How?

O'DONNELL

His Eminence decided Argo is 
credible.

Mendez, looking at the ticket. Barely believing it.

O'DONNELL (CONT’D)

His twelve year-old grandson is a 
science fiction nerd. Tonight he 
told Grandpa Turner about a movie 
he wants to see.

O'Donnell slaps down a copy of Comics Week. 

THE NEXT STAR WARS? Next to it, a photograph from the press 
event: Mendez holding a laser gun. CANADIAN EPIC WILL BE 
FILMED IN THE MIDDLE EAST.

Bartender brings a glass of scotch.

O'DONNELL (CONT’D)

(lifts his glass)

The United States government just  
officially sanctioned your science 
fiction movie.

INT. ARGO PRODUCTION OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON

Chambers and Lester are sitting in a pitch meeting with a 
couple of writers, JESSE and FRANK, early 30s.

62.

CHAMBERS

Is there anybody else who knows 
they’ve switched bodies?

JESSE

Just the old lady, the nosy 
neighbor --

SIEGEL

The mute one.

FRANK

Boo Radley, but a woman, and 
old --

Can’t talk but she can write.

JESSE

Chambers gets up to answer the phone.

JESSE

So she writes in the fog on her 
window -- y’know, backwards, she’s 
inside -- to tell Caroline --

SIEGEL

Sally Field --

Sally Field.

JESSE

Margot Kidder maybe --

FRANK

JESSE

(annoyed; they discussed 
this)

Sally Field. 

INT. MENDEZ APARTMENT - NIGHT

VOICE OF CHAMBERS

MENDEZ

Green light. Keep the office 
running till you hear otherwise.

(then, this means thank 
you)

Argo fuck yourself.

INT. ARGO PRODUCTION OFFICE - AFTERNOON

CHAMBERS

(quiet and worried)

Take care of yourself.

Chambers comes back to his chair. Raises his eyebrows at 
Lester. Then --

63.

SIEGEL

I’ll tellya right now, you’re not 
gonna get Kate Hepburn to play a 
mute. You’re talking No Lines At 
All?

FRANK

Well maybe she’s not mute. She 
could be --

FRANK (CONT’D)

Foreign.

SHY. Maybe She’s shy.

JESSE

INT. RURAL VIRGINIA HOUSE - MORNING

The phone in the living room rings. No one is home.

INT. DULLES - MORNING

Tony hangs up an airport payphone. 

CUT TO:

He sits near a mailbox inside the terminal writing on a 
postcard with the Washington Monument on it.

HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO THE BUDDY-MAN. NO PHONE FOR A WHILE. JACK 
WILL CALL. LOVE YOU BOTH. Then he adds: SO MUCH. 

He drops the card in the box and heads toward a gate marked 
LUFTHANSA.

INT. CANADIAN AMBASSADOR’S RESIDENCE, DINING ROOM - EVENING

Pat Taylor helps LEYLA, an Iranian housekeeper, clear dishes.

Did Shaheen not come in today?

PAT TAYLOR

Leyla shakes her head.

PAT TAYLOR (CONT’D)

Did she call?

Leyla shakes her head again. 

ON PAT -- very troubled -- as Leyla heads into the kitchen.

IN THE LIVING ROOM, NEARBY -- The Houseguests are playing 
Scrabble. Again. The sound of footsteps down the hall.

64.

BOB ANDERS

Dad’s home.

Ken comes in, carrying his briefcase. To the Houseguests -- 

TAYLOR

You’re getting a visitor.

INT. CIA, LANGLEY - MORNING

O’Donnell and Lamont are standing at a desk reading cables as 
they come through. Malinov, his eyes glazed over with Eastern 
European fatalism, walks up to O’Donnell.

O'DONNELL

(barely looking up)

Just one time, can you bring me 
good news? Anything. Your cat’s 
tumor is benign.

MALINOV

Vance just qualified his go-ahead. 
He says execution of Hollywood 
Option waits for Carter’s ok.

LAMONT

Fig leaf to cover his ass. 

This really isn’t good news. O’Donnell hates assholes  
micromanaging.

O'DONNELL

So we light a candle and pray Mr. 
Peanut doesn’t get nervous.

(going back to his office; 
kicks a mail cart)

Move this shit. Clean up your 
playroom.

EXT. BONN, WEST GERMANY - DAY

A tram that indicates the cold efficiency of Cold War 
Germany. 

Mendez, wearing a green turtleneck, walks near Hauptbahnhof, 
in the center of the city.

Super: BONN -- JANUARY 25

INT. IRANIAN EMBASSY, BONN - DAY

Mendez sits in a reception room with a few VISA APPLICANTS. 
Photographs of the Ayatollah Khomeini hang on the wall. Two 
REVOLUTIONARY GUARD OFFICIALS in ill-fitting suits sit at a 
desk.

65.

INT. IRANIAN EMBASSY, BONN; VISA OFFICE - DAY

The Iranian Consul Official, late 30s, is smoking.

CONSUL OFFICIAL (GERMAN)

What will be the purpose of your 
visit to Iran?

MENDEZ (GERMAN)
Business. Film production.

The Consul Official looks at the Irish passport.

CONSUL OFFICIAL (GERMAN)

Why didn’t you get your visa in 
Ireland?

MENDEZ (GERMAN)

My boss waited until I was in 
Germany to send the telex. 

(lighting cigarette)

If he had a thought in his head, it 
would die of loneliness.

Pointed look from Mendez. The universal condition of boss 
hatred almost always works for him, and it does now. Consul 
nods. Stamps the passport. KINGDOM OF IRAN -- He crosses out 
KINGDOM and writes by hand: ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF.

EXT. BENCH BY THE RIVER - AFTERNOON

Tony is staring at the cold January Rhine from a bench.

MAN’S VOICE   

I’ll tell you the recipe for 
extremism in all its forms... 

Mendez looks up. A man in his 60s slaps a TIME MAGAZINE with 
its 1979 MAN OF THE YEAR* -- AYATOLLAH KHOMEINI -- on the 
cover. (*1/7/80).

MAN 

Take bunch of 22 year-old men who 
can’t get laid. Hook them up with a 
geriatric with big ideas who can’t 
get laid either. 
(MORE)

MAN  (CONT'D)

And together they start a 
revolution, cause they’ve got the 
time to. Mr. Harkins.

66.

The Man is PETER NICHOLLS, late 40s, a Skull and Bones type 
and a very good spy.

CUT TO:

As they walk by the Rhine. 

NICHOLLS

I’d like to see your day-pass from 
a psych ward. You’re alone on this?

(Mendez nods)

It’s Dodge City, Kansas.

What were you doing over there?

MENDEZ

NICHOLLS

Metal detecting. Carter’s gonna 
freeze their assets. 

MENDEZ

You find anything?

NICHOLLS

What’s left. The Shah fled in a 747 
so loaded down with gold bars it 
barely got off the ground. 

INT. CAFE - NIGHT

Nicholls has WHITE AND YELLOW SLIPS OF PAPER with Farsi 
writing on them in hand.

NICHOLLS

Here’s the rub. Everybody who lands 
at Mehrabad now fills out one of 
these. 

(a WHITE one)

That slip makes a copy to this one 
underneath.

(the YELLOW one)

Passenger keeps Yellow, Airport 
keeps White. When you leave the 
country, the match them up to 
verify you came into the country 
when you said you did. 

MENDEZ

So if they look, they’ll know six 
people didn’t come in with me.

67.

NICHOLLS

If they look. N.E. says when you 
get there, you should go straight 
to the Ministry of Culture and 
Islamic Guidance to kiss the ring 
and pitch your movie. Get on record 
as having applied for permission to 
film. If they catch you later, 
they’ll at least be confused while 
they’re torturing you... Your 
biggest problem may be convincing 
the six of them to go with you. 
They’re State Department. They’re 
willful.

The Waitress brings two shots to the table.

You look like dogshit, Peter.

MENDEZ

June left.

I’m sorry.

NICHOLLS

MENDEZ

NICHOLLS

She gave me a choice. A Ring or 
Curtains. She’s a Chinese national. 
If I married her I’d have to 
resign, so... You and Christine?

MENDEZ

Good. Yeah.

He said that without hesitation. Maybe here we realize that 
Mendez is a very good liar.

Nice work if you can get it.

(doing a shot)

NICHOLLS

Salut... Have an extra for the 
plane. 

INT. RURAL VIRGINIA HOUSE - NIGHT

Phone ringing. Christine, carrying a laundry basket.

CHRISTINE

(yelling upstairs)

I got it! ... Hello?

O’DONNELL (V.O.)
Christine. Jack O’Donnell.

INT. O’DONNELL’S OFFICE - NIGHT (CROSS-CUTTING)

O’DONNELL

Tony wanted me to let you know he’s 
gonna be away. He won’t be able to 
call for a while.

68.

CHRISTINE

Where is he going?

O’DONNELL

I can’t tell you, love.

CHRISTINE

Is he safe?

O’DONNELL

Yes.

(a beat)

Of course he’s safe.

The “of course” part didn’t come out right and they both know 
it.

CHRISTINE

You should have stopped talking 
after “yes.”

INT. SWISSAIR DC 10 - MORNING

Mendez sits in a window seat.

CAPTAIN (V.O.)

From the flightdeck, we will be 
landing in Tehran shortly.

INT. MEHRABAD AIRPORT - DAY

Mendez walks through the terminal of a crowded 1960s-era 
airport. Newly-hung portraits of the Ayatollah Khomeini watch  
over the duty-free shops.

Super: TEHRAN - JANUARY 26

AT IMMIGRATION

Tony fills out a white form. It makes an impression on a 
YELLOW form.

Tony presents his Irish passport to a REVOLUTIONARY GUARD 
IMMIGRATION OFFICIAL. Official looks at it, Tony hears the 
sound of a woman screaming in Farsi.

69.

Three lanes away, at the outgoing immigration station, a 
Revolutionary Guard is dragging away the woman’s HUSBAND.

The Immigration Official stamps Tony’s passport -- takes the 
white form, gives Tony the yellow one -- and waves him 
through. 

EXT. TEHRAN - DAY

Archive footage may be mixed with new footage. Normal city 
life mixed with men with automatic weapons. The 
contradictions of Tehran at this moment. Women in chadors 
shaking their fists; a crowd at Kentucky Fried Chicken.

INT. TAXI - DAY

Mendez sits in the back of a taxi in the Tehran traffic, the  
worst traffic in the world, losing only to Bangkok, in a 
photo finish. 

ANGLES OUT HIS WINDOWS: the Ayatollah looks down from 
everywhere with eyeballs you expect to move and follow you. 
An ARMED GANG in the back of pick-up truck pulls up near his 
taxi.

TAXI DRIVER (FARSI)

416 Varasteh Road.

The driver stops. They’ve arrived.

INT. MINISTRY OF CULTURE AND ISLAMIC GUIDANCE - DAY

A large photograph of the Ayatollah stares down from above a 
desk. His picture is everywhere inside as well as out.

MEHDI BEHROUZ, 33, is the newly appointed Deputy Minister of 
Culture and Islamic Guidance. Like many of the stars of the 
Revolution, he was educated in the U.S. In his case, 
University of Chicago. Right now he’s looking at the ARGO 
script.

BEHROUZ

This film crew is just yourself?

MENDEZ

Six more are joining me today. 
They’re coming from Canada. They’ll 
be staying with the Canadian 
Ambassador.

BEHROUZ

You’d like to film at the Bazaar?

MENDEZ

The Bazaar, maybe the Palace.

70.

BEHROUZ

(not particularly 
friendly)

The exotic Orient. Snake charmers 
and flying carpets. 

(a beat)

I’ll review the script and speak 
with the Minister... You come to us 
at a complicated time. Before the 
Revolution, 40 percent of the movie 
theaters in Tehran were showing 
pornography. The function of this 
office is purification as well as 
promotion of the arts.

EXT. CANADIAN EMBASSY - DAY

Mendez, carrying his luggage, stands at a wrought iron gate 
with MAPLE LEAVES worked into the iron. Ken Taylor comes out 
of the building, opens the gate himself.

MENDEZ

Mr. Ambassador.

TAYLOR

Ken Taylor.

(shakes hands)

I was expecting more of a G-Man 
look.

MENDEZ

You’re thinking of FBI, sir. 

INT. CANADIAN EMBASSY, TAYLOR’S OFFICE - DAY

Taylor gives Tony EIGHT BLANK CANADIAN PASSPORTS.

TAYLOR

These are blank, y’know. The 
stamps?

MENDEZ

I’ll take care of that.

TAYLOR

How long?

MENDEZ

A day to prep them with their cover 
stories. Two if they need it.

71.

TAYLOR

And you’ll fly out with them? 

Tony nods. A distant sound of a crowd outside.

TAYLOR (CONT’D)

There’s something you should 
know... There’s a reward out for 
information about foreigners at 
large in the country. One of our 
housekeepers stopped showing up for 
work a couple of days ago. She knew 
about the Houseguests. 

Now the noise outside is louder. Taylor turns to the window. 
Tony joins him.

So sooner is better.

TAYLOR (CONT’D)

They stand watching a LARGE DEMONSTRATION passing the 
Sheraton beneath. There must be a thousand protestors. At the 
front, the burning of an American flag. 

A puppet of CARTER with devil horns. Signs with the Ayatollah 
Khomeini. An effigy of the SHAH with a noose around his neck.

NEWS FOOTAGE

Hodding Carter, boyish early 40s, State Department Press 
Secretary. (Briefing, *11/14/79)

CUT TO:

REPORTER

Hodding, have you had a chance to 
talk to this chap Kim King who told 
the story of his escape from the 
embassy after it was seized and his 
reference to Americans who escaped?

O'Donnell and Malinov are watching.

ROSSI

(entering)

Mendez got to the Canadians.

HODDING CARTER (ON T.V.)

... let me deal with that one by 
saying this. If there are any 
Americans who are at large in 
Tehran or elsewhere, who belong to 
the official party, the most 
irresponsible thing I could do 
would be to confirm it.

72.

MALINOV

They ran out of news. They’re going 
fishing.

HODDING CARTER (O.S.)

I’m simply not going to deal 
with the question under any 
of these guises.

LAMONT

And they can see his nose 
growing. 

LAMONT

If the story breaks while he’s over 
there, we’ll have armageddon. 

ODONNELL

(eyes on the tv)

What we’ll have is a drag show. 
Tony’s body. Dragged through the 
streets. For the benefit of the 
cameras.

INT. CAR - EVENING

Ken Taylor drives up to a two-story white house behind a gate 
with a sloping lawn and a Canadian flag in front of it. 
Automatic gates open.

EXT./INT. CANADIAN AMBASSADOR’S RESIDENCE - EVENING

Taylor leads Mendez inside. Pat Taylor waits for them in the 
hall. Takes Tony’s hand.

PAT TAYLOR

Just tell me you’re not going to 
get them killed. 

(takes his hand)

Pat Taylor.

Kevin Harkins.

MENDEZ

PAT TAYLOR

(leading them inside)

Is that your real name?

MENDEZ

I’m not allowed to say my real 
name.

PAT TAYLOR

I should have made one up too. I am 
Electra, Warrior Queen. They’re in 
here.

73.

INT. CANADIAN AMBASSADOR’S RESIDENCE, TEHRAN - EVENING

They enter the DINING ROOM... and here are the SIX 
HOUSEGUESTS. They’re looking at Mendez like kids waiting to 
be told the lesson plan.

INT. ARGO PRODUCTION OFFICE - MORNING

Siegel puts the key in the door. Stares at the lock. Turns to 
Chambers.

SIEGEL

You didn’t lock the office last 
night?

I did lock it.

CHAMBERS

They enter and look at the empty Argo office. No one’s here. 
No visible signs of disturbance. They’re spooked.

INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Each Houseguest has a copy of the ARGO script.

BOB ANDERS

It’s theater of the absurd.

MARK LIJEK
What are the chances?

MENDEZ

The chances are good.

MARK LIJEK

What’s the number value of “good”? 
30 percent chance of success? 80 
percent?

CORA LIJEK

We just ...

MARK LIJEK

Cora’s pregnant. We decided we 
weren’t leaving under risky 
circumstances. We’d rather risk 
staying.

BOB ANDERS

What was the objection to picking 
normal cover identities?

74.

MENDEZ

There are no Canadians in the 
country for normal reasons.

KATHY STAFFORD
They’ll sniff us out 
regardless. 

MARK LIJEK

The Swedish consul said they 
accused him of being an 
American at the airport and 
held him for an hour. 

BOB ANDERS

We can’t stand up to that. We don’t 
know what the hell movie people do.

MENDEZ

That’s why I’m here. I’ll be with 
you. This is what I do.

(a beat)

I’d like you to take a vote. 

CORA LIJEK

Have you gotten people out this way 
before?

MENDEZ

This would be a first.

ANGLE on the one Houseguest who hasn’t spoken. JOE STAFFORD

CUT TO:

The Houseguests, minus Joe and Kathy Stafford, go into the 
living room. Mendez stays in his seat.

JOE STAFFORD
You should read this. 

The puts the TEHRAN TIMES, the English language Iranian 
newspaper, in front of Mendez.

JOE STAFFORD (CONT’D)

Do you know that every day...

KATHY STAFFORD

... Joe, don’t.

JOE STAFFORD (CONT’D)

... every day they catch another 
friend of the shah at the airport. 
Midnight trials then the firing 
squad. Just for having American 
names in their phone books.

He puts the paper down. Goes into the living room, followed 
by Kathy.

75.

ANGLE ON - The PHOTOGRAPH in the Tehran Times. A MAN IN A 
SUIT at Mehrabad Airport. Confused and terrified. Being led 
out at gunpoint.

EXT. BACK VERANDA - NIGHT

Mendez comes out and lights a cigarette. Ken Taylor is 
already there, also smoking.

TAYLOR

They don’t really have the option 
of staying, you know. We’ve got 
orders to close our embassy and go 
back. There’s nowhere for them to 
stay.

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

JOE STAFFORD

I’m serious too. This is what?

BOB ANDERS

Don’t do this, Joe ...

JOE STAFFORD

... the part where we say 
“That’s so crazy it just 
might work”? C’mon ...

BOB ANDERS

I saw it in Burma. They get people 
out. They know how.

JOE STAFFORD

... snitches in banana republics. 
They get them over the border after 
the coup...

BOB ANDERS

That’s your opinion.

JOE STAFFORD

... pay the guards at the 
crossing a hundred bucks to 
look the other way...

LEE SCHATZ

His opinion got us out of the 
embassy in the first place.

EXT. VERANDA - NIGHT

MENDEZ

If we go, you should plan to be on 
the next flight. There’s a danger--

76.

TAYLOR

Pat and I discussed it. If they 
catch you at the airport, they come 
here and we go on trial for 
harboring the enemy. It’s a risk we 
took.

(after a moment)

Can you pull this off?

MENDEZ

I don’t know.

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

JOE STAFFORD

That man out there, he’s got bad 
cards, he’s gonna lose. If he 
loses, it’s our lives. 

KATHY STAFFORD

(after a beat)

And his own.

Another beat. Angles on the Houseguests. Then Mark Lijek 
takes a piece of paper and rips it into six pieces. He takes 
an antique BOWL from an end table and puts it on the coffee 
table in the center of the room. Then, handing a piece to 
each Houseguest.

MARK LIJEK
Write ‘yes’ or ‘no.’

Mark Lijek takes a piece of paper out of the antique bowl and 
unfolds it. He lays it on the coffee table with five other 
unfolded pieces of paper.  The Houseguests look at the papers 
and at each ther. We can’t see what the papers say. 

CUT TO:

EXT. VERANDA - NIGHT

Mendez stands alone, looking into the night. The back door 
opens. He turns.

LEE SCHATZ

It’s yes.

INT. ARGO PRODUCTION OFFICE - AFTERNOON

Siegel is watching television when suddenly, a DOOR SLAMS 
behind him. He flinches, turns. It’s just Chambers. 

77.

SIEGEL

Jesus.

Chambers joins Siegel, who is watching Jimmy Carter on t.v.

JIMMY CARTER (ON T.V.)

I never forget one moment that I’m 
awake about the hostages whose 
lives and safety depends on me.

Carter is speaking at a White House press conference on 
television. (*1/18/80). After a beat.

SIEGEL

John Wayne’s in the ground six 
months and there’s no more MEN in 
this country, y’know what I mean? 
He’s like evolution’s perfect 
animal for delivering bad news. 
Look at his eyes, he don’t even 
have to talk and you know there’s 
bad news... Forget the politics, 
just gimme Eisenhower, gimme 
MacArthur. Gimme Gregory Peck 
playing MacArthur. The country’s 
tired of bad news.

INT. SHERATON HOTEL - NIGHT

A TELEFAX MACHINE spells out a message, letter by letter. 

MR KEVIN HARKINS - CARE OF HOTEL SHERATON

INT. CANADIAN AMBASSADOR’S RESIDENCE - NIGHT

Mendez holds a passport and some papers in front of Bob 
Anders’s face. It’s late now. The Houseguests are tired, 
sweating, sitting around a dining room. Mendez, sleeves 
rolled up.  The ARGO STORYBOARDS are scattered around the 
room.

MENDEZ

You’re not a film director.

BOB ANDERS
I am a film director.

MENDEZ

What’s the name of the first film 
you directed?

Bob Anders is silent. He doesn’t know.

78.

MENDEZ (CONT’D)

He’s an American spy. Shoot him.

Mendez throws down the passport. ANGLES on the Houseguests. 
Pale, sweating. They’ve been at this a while.

MENDEZ (CONT’D)

You’ve got to know your résumé 
front and back. They’ll try to 
break you by getting you agitated.

Mendez moves on around the table to Kathy Stafford.

MENDEZ (CONT’D)

Where was your passport issued?

KATHY STAFFORD

Vancouver.

MENDEZ

Where were you born?

KATHY STAFFORD

Toronto.

MENDEZ

Toronno. Canadians don’t pronounce 
the T.

JOE STAFFORD

(getting fed up)

The border guard won’t know that.

MENDEZ

If we’re held for questioning, 
they’ll bring in somebody who knows 
that.

The Houseguests look at each other.

MENDEZ (CONT’D)

We’ll go again in the morning. 

Tony has a new heaviness in his eyes. Maybe he can’t pull 
this off. 

INT. SHERATON ROOM - LATE 

Tony is PREPPING the CANADIAN PASSPORTS -- expertly copying 
Farsi stamps with a very thin paintbrush. A KNOCK on the 
door. Tony hides the passports. Answers the door.

BELLHOP

Sir, a telex arrived earlier.

79.

The Bellhop hands Tony a piece of paper.

MENDEZ (V.O.)

“The Minister of Culture and 
Guidance has approved your location 
scout.

INT. SHERATON ROOM - A FEW MINUTES LATER

Mendez, on the phone -- 

MENDEZ

(reading the telefax)

“He will send a representative to 
meet you and your crew at the 
Khayyam entrance to the Grand 
Bazaar tomorrow at 3 p.m.”  

INT. O’DONNELL’S OFFICE - DAY

O’Donnell on the phone -- an IRAN EXPERT from NEAR EASTERN 
Bureau, 30s, is in his office with him.

O’DONNELL

They called your bluff. 

MENDEZ

Or maybe they’re cooperating.

O’DONNELL

N.E.’s saying absolutely not. You 
cannot take those people scouting a 
Western film at the bazaar. It’s 
the hive. It’s Khomeini’s support 
base.

MENDEZ

Refusing confirms we’re not who we 
say we are. Refusing brings the 
hive to us.

O’DONNELL

Are they ready with their covers?

MENDEZ

They’re getting there.

O’DONNELL

There’s no prize for Most Improved. 
Are they ready?

INT. CANADIAN AMBASSADOR’S RESIDENCE, KITCHEN - NIGHT

Mark Lijek and Joe Stafford are sitting up watching a press 
conference of the Ayatollah speaking.* (*11/12/79). Mark 
Lijek translates for Joe.

80.

MARK LIJEK

‘We are a nation of 35 million 
and... many of these people are 
looking forward to martyrdom. We--’

Kathy Stafford looks into the room. Mark stops talking -- Joe 
looks up.

JOE STAFFORD

(to Kathy)
Five minutes? 

He smiles at her. Kathy, who looks like she hasn’t been 
sleeping, nods and leaves. After a moment -- 

JOE STAFFORD (CONT’D)

She pleaded with me.

Mark, looking to Joe. This is new.

JOE STAFFORD (CONT’D)

When the shit in the streets 
started nine months ago. She begged 
for us to leave. She packed our 
bags. I said, ‘A little longer.’ 
And what I was thinking was, ‘This 
is a good thing. Stay. Show Newsom 
you’ve got the balls. Grab for the 
ring.’

(a beat)

I think we’re gonna die here. 

INT. KOMITEH HEADQUARTERS, AMIR ABAD DISTRICT - NIGHT

The feeling here is dangerous. Young Men carrying automatic 
weapons casually. The exhilaration of young men who have 
turned the world upside down.

Behrouz stands next to ALI KHALKALI, 30s, a Revolutionary 
Committee security official. He is looking at Tony’s STUDIO 
SIX business card and the ARGO script.

INT. SHERATON BALCONY - MORNING

Tony looks at one of the Argo storyboards -- one depicting an 
EXTOTIC SPICE MARKET, a BAZAR -- in the light.

CORA LIJEK (V.O.)
This isn’t what we voted on.

81.

INT. CANADIAN AMBASSADOR’S RESIDENCE - MORNING

The Houseguests are gathered in the kitchen. Cora hands the 
telefax to Bob Anders. Joe Stafford, looking on.

CORA LIJEK

You said “straight to the airport.” 
You said that.

BOB ANDERS

It’s because they suspect?

MENDEZ

What I know is we need to act like 
a movie crew. We go to the bazaar 
today, we fly out tomorrow. 

Silent assent among the group. Then Joe Stafford, sitting 
with his wife, speaks up --

JOE STAFFORD

We won’t do it.

MARK LIJEK

He told them there were six of us. 
They’re expecting six.

JOE STAFFORD

(to Mendez)

You are about to show the only card 
we’re holding. Which is that they 
don’t know we’re here. 

MENDEZ

I’m asking you to trust me.

JOE STAFFORD

I don’t trust you.

BOB ANDERS
(fed up, to Joe)

Do you have an alternative? This is 
the ball game, Joe. For Christ’s 
sake, what world are you living in?

JOE STAFFORD

The real world. 

Joe takes Kathy’s hand and goes, leaving Mendez with the 
others. After a moment -- 

MARK LIJEK

(to Mendez)

So we’ll see you at two?

82.

INT. CARPET FACTORY - MORNING

A KOMITEH BOSS inspects the work of the carpet weaving kids, 
who labor quietly.  Dozens of documents are now complete, 
sitting on the floor in rows. Some pages from the EMBASSY MUG 
BOOK are now re-assembled. The Boss picks one of the pages 
up.

EXT. CANADIAN AMBASSADOR’S RESIDENCE - DAY

PAT TAYLOR

This one.

Pat Taylor gives Cora Lijek a Candian maple-leaf lapel pin. 
Cora pins it to her shirt, looks in the mirror.  Joe and 
Kathy Stafford look to each other. Sitting reading newspapers 
while the other Houseguests dress for the scout. The PHONE 
starts ringing.

PAT TAYLOR (CONT’D)

(answering the phone)

Hello? 

A cloud comes over Pat as she listens.

PAT TAYLOR (CONT’D)

No, there’s no one like that here.

She hangs up the phone fast, as if it were hot to the touch.

PAT TAYLOR (CONT’D)

He asked to speak to the Americans.

Who was it?

CORA LIJEK

Pat shakes her head. ON Joe Stafford listening. Kathy takes 
his hand.

KATHY STAFFORD

(to Joe)

Somebody knows.

INT. SHERATON ROOM - DAY

Tony sits on his bed, next to the phone. Thinking.

83.

He gets up and leaves, and we start to hear the sound of a 
man talking fast in Farsi.

EXT. CAR RENTAL - DAY

It’s a CAR RENTAL MAN, 60s, speaking. Tony is looking at a 
MINI-VAN on a lot of beaten-up rental cars. 

MENDEZ

This one, how much? One day, how 
much? 

EXT. CANADIAN AMBASSADOR’S RESIDENCE - DAY

Four of Houseguests are waiting out front, dressed in their 
best approximation of the clothes of a movie scout crew. Cora 
has the maple leaf flag pin on her shirt. 

They turn when they see the mini-van that Tony was looking at 
pull up to the residence. Mendez gets out. 

LEE SCHATZ

(here we are)

One two three four. 

While the Houseguests board the van, Bob Anders takes Tony 
aside.

BOB ANDERS

Somebody called the house asking 
for us.

MENDEZ

Who?

Bob Anders shrugs. Tony heads into the house...

INT. CANADIAN AMBASSADOR’S RESIDENCE, KITCHEN - DAY

... to find Joe Stafford sitting at the table. Kathy has her 
hand on his. They are badly shaken.

MENDEZ

I promise you that if you will play 
along today, I will get you out 
tomorrow. 

JOE STAFFORD

We have a family at home, Mr. 
Harkins.

84.

MENDEZ

I have a family at home too.

Mr. Mendez.

(a beat)

Mendez goes back out to the mini-van. Stay with Joe and 
Kathy.

INT. MINI-VAN - DAY

Mendez, in the driver’s seat, looks at the house, then at his 
watch. He starts up the van, filled with four of the 
Houseguests. Then he looks in the rear-view and sees one of 
the back doors open. Joe and Kathy Stafford board.

EXT. TEHRAN - DAY

Tony drives the mini-van through streets of Tehran. The 
Houseguests sit in silence, looking out the windows. It’s the 
first time they’ve been out in the city since the embassy 
siege. There is a vehement DEMONSTRATION going on -- stars-
and-stripes burning in Molavi Square.

MENDEZ

Tell me who you are.

This recalls attention from the windows.

LEE SCHATZ

Mike McEwan, cameraman.

BOB ANDERS

Robert Baker, director.

MARK LIJEK

Timothy Harris, screenwriter.

Mary Ann Boyd, location manager.

CORA LIJEK

KATHY STAFFORD

Rachel Dewart, set designer.

Kathy looks at her husband.

JOE STAFFORD

Sean Bissett, associate producer.

MENDEZ

Let’s make a movie.

85.

EXT. STREET NEAR THE BAZAAR - DAY

The mini-van double parks on Musavi Street.  Taxis, men 
loading and unloading rolled-up carpets onto pickup trucks, 
chaos.

A YOUNG MAN IN A TIE waits. This is REZA, mid 20s, a low-
level administrator in the Ministry of Guidance.

Mendez gets out and they speak and shake hands. The image 
FREEZES. In a BLACK AND WHITE PHOTOGRAPH. And, in the 
REVERSE, we realize that we’ve been watching from the 
perspective of a REVOLUTIONARY GUARD PHOTOGRAPHER across the 
street.

He takes another photograph. This time focusing on the 
distinctive moustached face of LEE SCHATZ.

EXT./INT. TEHRAN BAZAAR - DAY

Reza is leading Mendez and the group of Houseguests through 
the Tehran Bazaar. A word about the place: the world’s 
largest bazaar. 10 kilometers of narrow alleys. Chinese-made 
Swiss watches, banks, mosques, butchers, fabric stores, gold 
stands. Boys with hand-trucks loaded down with piles of 
fabric cut through the crowd. It’s not a Marrakesh timeless 
kind of place: older Islamic architecture elbows up against 
neon signs and rickety wooden stands with second story 
balconies like Bourbon Street.

Bob Anders walks toward the front.

REZA

You are the director?

BOB ANDERS

Yes.

REZA
(pleasant)

Is this film a foreign bride film?

BOB ANDERS

I’m sorry?

REZA

A film where a foreign bride is 
brought to Iran, but she doesn’t 
understand the language and customs 
and there are misunderstandings and 
laughs.

BOB ANDERS

No.

86.

REZA

(not happy with that 
answer)

Mmmm.

Mendez walking toward the back of the group. Lee, the 
cameraman, is looking through a viewfinder down the alley of 
the bazaar.

MENDEZ

(quiet)

Mike? 

LEE SCHATZ
(not looking up)

Yeh.

MENDEZ

If I said you were looking through 
the wrong end of that viewfinder, 
would I be right?

Lee turns the viewfinder around and looks through it again.

ANGLE

Mendez talking to Lee from a distance. A zoom, a closer 
snapshot of LEE. Then of CORA LIJEK, who walks through the 
bazaar with an open ARGO SCRIPT in her hand. 

The Revolutionary Guard photographer is taking pictures of 
each of the Houseguests, picking their portraits off one by 
one like a sniper.

Now, a black and white still of MENDEZ. The still returns to 
life, and a beat on Mendez. Looking in the direction of the 
photographer. He knows something’s up.

INT. TEHRAN BAZAAR - DAY

Reza leads the Houseguests Mendez and the Houseguests deeper 
into this city within a city. The bazaar should seem more 
forbidding and than even the rest of revolutionary Tehran, 
fundamentalist ground zero. Now they’re at a street dedicated 
to gold and jewelry. BAZAARIS stand at their shop doors; 
puzzled; unfriendly; some with their arms akimbo;  watching 
the visitors.

Kathy Stafford, the production designer on the scout, takes a 
Polaroid of a window adorned in gold. The SHOPKEEPER, a 70-
ish bazaari, sees her do so. 

He hurries out of his store, speaking in rapid-fire Farsi at 
her. The Houseguests stop. Reza speaks to the Shopkeeper in 
Farsi, then --

87.

REZA
(to Kathy)

He wants the photograph you took.

MENDEZ

She’s the production designer. Her 
job is to take photographs.

SHOPKEEPER getting more and more heated in Farsi.

REZA

He says he did not give you 
permission to take a photograph of 
his store.

Other BAZAARIS and SHOPPERS are starting to gather. Kathy 
holds out the Polaroid toward the Shopkeeper.

KATHY STAFFORD

He can have the photograph. Tell 
him --

The Shopkeeper knocks the Polaroid out of her hand.

IN THE BAZAAR

People are now starting to surround Mendez and Reza and the 
Houseguests. Bazaaris more and more heated. Women in chadors 
are screaming and finger-pointing.

ANGRY MAN

(in English)

America NO! ... NO!

Then he speaks in Farsi and makes shooting gestures with his 
hand.

LEE SCHATZ

(quiet, to Mendez)

He’s saying the shah killed his son  
with an American gun.

Cauldron is getting warmer. ANGLES ON: more and more Bazaaris  
start to gather around the group. ON Kathy -- her 
claustrophobia as the crowd closes in -- a WOMAN sticks her 
finger in Kathy’s face -- 

CORA LIJEK

(to one of the Women)

Canada... Ca-na-da ...

She shows a Canadian flag lapel button.

88.

LEE SCHATZ

(quiet, to Mendez)

He says we’re the CIA taking 
photographs to plan the bombing of 
the city.

REZA

I would like to suggest that we end 
our visit?

MENDEZ

We think that’s a good idea.

Reza indicates an exit to the street. The CROWD heckles the 
Houseguests as they walk toward the exit. One or two might 
even spit on them.

INT. MINI-VAN - AFTERNOON

The aftermath: headed back to the Ambassador’s. The 
Houseguests, badly shaken. Catching their breath. Mark Lijek 
has his arm around Cora. She wants to cry, but is determined 
not to be That Girl Who Cries, so she bites her cheek. Kathy 
still in shock from the Polaroid incident. Anders, adrenaline 
flowing. Joe, stewing.

MENDEZ

You did well. You did very well.

INT. O’DONNELL’S OFFICE - MORNING

Coffee mug on the desk. O’Donnell’s there late.

O’DONNELL

They drew you out there to take 
your picture. They could have 
melted. 

INT. CANADIAN AMBASSADOR’S RESIDENCE - AFTERNOON (CROSS-
CUTTING)

Mendez is in the phone in Ken Taylor’s home office.

MENDEZ

They didn’t.

O’DONNELL

You got lucky. The cover story’s 
too hard. They can’t hold it at the 
airport. 

MENDEZ
They’ll hold it.

89.

O’DONNELL

They’ll blow themselves and you.
You gotta call the game.

(after a beat)

There are already 50 at the 
embassy. There’ll be six more.

ON Mendez, not believing what he’s hearing.

ODONNELL

There’s been a development. You on 
scrambler?

MENDEZ

What do you think?

ODONNELL

(quiet, fast, clear)

Joint Chiefs are planning a 
military rescue of the hostages in 
a month. Delta Force started  
training to storm the grounds. So 
if the six of them get brought 
there, they won’t be held for long. 

MENDEZ

If I leave, they’ll be found here. 
I never would have exposed them if 
I wasn’t authorized to take them 
out.

ODONNELL

Tony --

MENDEZ

They will be taken. Probably not 
ALIVE --

ODONNELL

For one fucking minute, LISTEN TO 
ME. The thinking’s changed 
upstairs. Six Americans get pulled 
out of a Canadian diplomat’s house 
and executed, it’s another world 
outrage. Six Americans get caught 
playing movie make-believe with the 
CIA at the airport and executed, 
it’s a national embarrassment. 
They’re calling the operation.

MENDEZ

We’re responsible for those people.

90.

ODONNELL
(genuinely sad)

What we are is required to follow 
my orders. I’m sorry.

Mendez has hung up. O’Donnell sits listening to the dial tone 
for a moment, then puts the phone on the receiver. Then, very 
suddenly, he looks at his coffee cup, half full, and 
backhands it off his desk.

INT. CANADIAN AMBASSADOR’S RESIDENCE - NIGHT

Bob Anders, a handful of liquor bottles in his arms, walks by 
Mendez, who has a scotch in his hand. Music plays on a record 
player. 

BOB ANDERS

Scorched earth policy tonight. 
Nothing gets left behind.

Taylor, drink in hand, thoughts heavy, looks at Tony. 

MENDEZ

So you know?

TAYLOR

(nods)

ExtAff wants you burn their  
passports before you leave. Don’t 
get caught with them in your bag.

Mendez looks at the Houseguests, prepping dinner.

MENDEZ

Will you tell them?

TAYLOR

(a beat)

If I do, they’ll panic. It’s better 
if you just don’t show.

It was always a fucked mission. You 
came closer than anybody else. 

Kathy and Cora are cracking each other up -- a mini flour-
fight at the sink. There’s hope in them.

INT. CAR - NIGHT

Mendez drives through nighttime Tehran, back to the hotel. 

Then, as if saying something to test a recording device or to 
hear what his own voice sounds like for the first time.

91.

MENDEZ

That’s all, folks... That’s all, 
folks. That’s all, folks. That’s 
all, folks.

Mendez keeps repeating it to himself. Hitting the steering 
wheel. He’s very very low.

EXT. RURAL VIRGINIA ROAD - AFTERNOON

Christine driving, Michael in the passenger seat. She pulls 
up to the roadside mailbox outside the passenger side at the 
entrance to a dirt road.

MICHAEL

More ... more ... more ... STOP.

She’s inching the car forward. It’s their ritual. Christine 
pulls the car close enough to the box that Michael can open 
it the window without getting out of the car.

Michael opens the box pulls a stack of mail. He flips 
through. Catalogs for his grandmother... Bills ... then, 
Tony’s postcard with the Washington monument on it. LOVE YOU 
BOTH SO MUCH. He shows it to his mother.

INT. ARGO PRODUCTION OFFICE - AFTERNOON

Chambers, listening on a phone, shakes his head at Siegel. He 
hangs up.

CHAMBERS

It’s off. They want us to pack up 
the office.

EXT. TEHRAN - DAWN

The city waking up.

INT. CANADIAN AMBASSADOR’S RESIDENCE - DAWN

The Houseguests, getting dressed. Suiting up for the airport. 

Ken Taylor watches in the hall. He looks at Pat. Sad, silent.

EXT. SHERATON ROOM - DAWN

Tony sits a a table looking out the window.

92.

INT. CANADIAN AMBASSADOR’S RESIDENCE - MORNING

Lee Schatz puts his Infant of Prague holy card into an Argo 
script. Packs the script.

Cora Lijek is sitting on the stairs next to her husband. One 
of his arms is around her. His other hand rubs her stomach.

Kathy Stafford looks at the clock.

KATHY STAFFORD

(to Joe Stafford)

He’s late.

EXT. SHERATON BALCONY - EARLY MORNING

Tony comes out to the balcony with a hotel ice bucket in one 
hand and the Canadian passports in the other. He puts the 
passports in the bucket, LIGHTS A MATCH. 

He looks down at the match, at the passports. The first 
stirrings of the morning calls-to-prayer echo in the 
distance. 

HOLD for a long beat on Tony. Thinking. 

Then, HE BLOWS OUT THE MATCH.

INT. O’DONNELL’S OFFICE - NIGHT

O’Donnell is packing up for the night. Paper towels sit on 
top of the coffee spill on his rug. 

His phone rings. He picks up.

O’DONNELL

Yeah.

INT. SHERATON ROOM - EARLY MORNING

MENDEZ

I am RESPONSIBLE. Somebody is 
RESPONSIBLE for things when things 
happen, Jack. A PERSON.

(a beat)

I’m taking them through.

And before Jack can answer, Tony hangs up. Stands. A duffel 
bag over his shoulder, Tony turns out the light in the hotel 
room. Goes.

93.

INT. CIA, LANGLEY - NIGHT

O’Donnell, thinking. Looking at the phone. Then, with a 
sudden decision, he gets up.

Rushing out of his office. To ALAN FRANKLIN, a Directorate of 
Support officer, the guy who allocates the money, one of the 
few black employees we’ve seen at the CIA.

O’DONNELL

We need to confirm those seven 
tickets out of Tehran on Swissair--

FRANKLIN

N.E. shut that down. 

O’DONNELL

I’m saying it’s back on!

FRANKLIN

I can’t do it. It’s backstopped 
pending Executive Branch GO. 

O’DONNELL

What the fuck does that mean?

FRANKLIN

Carter’s got to say yes for us to 
get the tickets.

INT. CANADIAN AMBASSADOR’S RESIDENCE - MORNING

Pat Taylor, wearing a bathrobe, heads downstairs to answer 
the insistent knocking on her front door. She opens it.

PAT TAYLOR

Kevin.

She’s shocked to see him. Ken Taylor now appears behind Pat. 
In the hall behind him: The Houseguests are assembled, 
waiting to go. They look their parts -- or, much more so than 
they did on the scout. Bob Anders looks like Fellini, or 
someone playing Marcello playing Fellini. Cora Lijek has 
darker hair. The Staffords look on, fully dressed.

INT. OUTSIDE ENGELL’S OFFICE - NIGHT

O’DONNELL

Where’s Engell?

SECRETARY

He’s in a meeting.

O’DONNELL

PULL HIM OUT!

Pull him out.

(she hesitates)

94.

EXT. CANADIAN AMBASSADOR’S RESIDENCE - DAWN

Pat Taylor is embracing the Houseguests, saying goodbye as 
they get into the mini-van.

MENDEZ

(to Ken Taylor)

You go now too.

Ken Taylor nods. Mendez shakes his hand, hurries to the van.

INT./EXT. MINI-VAN - DAWN

Mendez gets into the driver’s seat. Lee Schatz, on the 
passenger side.

LEE SCHATZ

Switch. I know how to get there.

Mendez takes the passenger seat and Lee climbs into the 
driver’s seat. Pulls away.

INT. OUTSIDE ENGELL’S OFFICE - NIGHT

ENGELL

N.E. said NO, this is not a long-
leasher ...

O’DONNELL

... watching the show behind 
a one-way whorehouse 
mirror...

ENGELL

... and it never has been. 
YOU don’t decide if it goes 
...

O’DONNELL

It is going. 

ENGELL

You’re goddamn close ...

O’DONNELL
Am I goddamn close?

ENGELL

You’re goddamn close to the line 
with me.

95.

O’DONNELL

(interrupting)

I’m not leaving him at the airport 
with six people and his dick in his 
hand. Tell the Director to call the 
White House. DO YOUR FUCKING JOB.

Engell just stares O’Donnell down. Then O’Donnell storms out 
of the office.

EXT./INT. MINI-VAN - MORNING

The van speeds down the hills of the Shemiran district. 

MENDEZ

The first checkpoint is just to 
look at your passport. Your 
passports came straight from the 
Canadians, so you’re gonna be fine.

INT. CIA, LANGLEY - A MOMENT LATER

O’Donnell, charging in --

O’DONNELL

Where’s the Director?

MALINOV

He’s on a plane.

O’DONNELL

Find White House Chief of Staff.

MALINOV

How would I find him?

O’DONNELL

We’re a fucking SPY AGENCY! FIND 
HIM!

INT. CANADIAN EMBASSY VAN - MORNING

MENDEZ

The second checkpoint --

Lee Schatz brakes hard as he almost hits a MAN ON A MOPED. 
Mendez and the Houseguests hold on.

96.

INT. CIA, WAR ROOM - NIGHT

MALINOV

Jordan’s in the West Wing. He’s not 
taking calls.

A beat on O’Donnell.

O’DONNELL

Where do his kids go to school?

LAMONT

WHAT?

O’DONNELL

Find out where his kids go to 
school!

INT. MINI-VAN - MORNING

MENDEZ

The second is immigration. You’ll 
hand them these. They say you 
landed two days ago. 

He gives out yellow immigration forms to the Houseguests.

MENDEZ (CONT’D)

These guys are bureaucrats left 
over from the shah. They can’t be 
bothered to second-guess you.

INT. CIA, WAR ROOM - NIGHT

Malinov slams a phone down.

MALINOV

Georgetown Day!

O’Donnell dials a number. 

O’DONNELL

Yes, this is Mr. Murphy from 
Georgetown Day School for Mr. 
Jordan... I’m afraid IS an 
emergency...

INT. WHITE HOUSE OPERATOR ROOM - DAY

WHITE HOUSE OPERATOR

Hold just a moment.

She plugs a wire into an old-fashioned Ma Bell switchboard.

MENDEZ (V.O.)

Third checkpoint is the trap.

97.

INT. MINI-VAN - MORNING

MENDEZ

It’s manned by Revolutionaries 
who’ve appointed themselves 
guardians of the republic. The same 
people who took the embassy. Most  
of them were educated in the U.S. 
or Europe.

BOB ANDERS

Or Canada?

MENDEZ

They know how many Ts are in 
Toronto.

INT. WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF OFFICE - NIGHT

Jordan is in a meeting with two staffers, his feet up on the 
desk. His Secretary opens the door without knocking, hurries 
to Jordan, whispers something in his ear. He immediately 
grabs the phone.

JORDAN

Hello?

O’DONNELL

Jack O’Donnell from C.I.

JORDAN

Wait... WHO?

O’DONNELL

Tehran Houseguest operation is 
ready NOW. We don’t have the 
president’s go-ahead. They are 
going to be captured.

Jordan stands up with the phone.

JORDAN

(yelling out his door)

BEN! Pick up!

98.

INT. KOMITEH OFFICE - MORNING

The office we visited earlier. Two YOUNG KOMITEH wearing open 
collar shirts look at BLACK AND WHITE 8 by 10s of the 
photographs of the Houseguests from the bazaar in front of 
them and are comparing the photographs to xeroxes of a 
reconstructed U.S. Embassy ledger. 

In front of the komiteh: on one side, copies of diplomatic 
photographs of Americans -- like the ones of the Houseguests 
we saw early in the film -- and, on the other side, the 
candid photographs from the bazaar.

INT. CIA, WAR ROOM - NIGHT

AIDE
Telex on Flash.

The telex begins to print, line by line ...

EYES ONLY -- OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES -- 
HOLLYWOOD OPTION APPROVED -- GOOD LUCK. (*Carter White House 
telex, 1/29/1980).

O’DONNELL

Copy D.S.! Confirm the tickets! GO!

INT. SWISSAIR COUNTER, MEHRABAD - MORNING

Mendez’s Irish passports and the Houseguests’ Canadian 
passports sit on the counter.

SWISSAIR REP

I’m sorry, sir. I don’t have those 
reservations ...

Swissair Rep looks at some green text on her screen, hits 
another button. 

SWISSAIR REP (CONT’D)

My apologies. They just came 
through. 

She hits another button and tickets start to print on a slow 
printer under the counter.

INT. CIA, LANGLEY - NIGHT

(to O’Donnell, holding a 
phone)

MALINOV

(MORE)

99.

MALINOV (CONT'D)

Swissair says they’ve picked up the 
tickets.

O’DONNELL

They’re heading to the checkpoints. 
Get the L.A. office -- tell them to 
be ready in case they call.

MALINOV

We told them to shut that down!

He RUNS toward a phone --

INT. MEHRABAD AIRPORT, FIRST CHECKPOINT - MORNING

The Passport Official is looking at the Canadian passports of 
the six and waving them through. Mendez has already passed. 
Everyone except Kathy Stafford.

The Passport Official looks at Kathy, who is doing his best 
to look friendly and casual. Then he looks at Kathy’s 
passport, in which she looks stern and angry.

PASSPORT OFFICIAL

Is this you?

Kathy Stafford smooths down her hair frowns like she does in 
the passport photo. The Passport Official half smiles and 
waves her through. They’ve all cleared the first checkpoint.

BOB ANDERS

(to Lee Schatz)
One down, two to go.

INT. KOMITEH OFFICE - MORNING

One of the Young Komiteh -- one with a Moustache -- comes 
upon a diplomatic photograph of a Man With Glasses.  

He starts to leaf through the photographs from the bazaar.

QUICK CUT TO:

POV of the Revolutionary Guard Photographer -- Mark Lijek 
being photographed at the bazaar the previous day

QUICK CUT BACK:

Moustache looks at the black and white still of Mark Lijek, 
compares it to his diplomatic picture, the first portrait we 
saw of Mark toward the beginning of the film. MATCH.

Moustache stands up. SHOUTS in Farsi to another Komiteh --

INT. MEHRABAD AIRPORT, SECOND CHECKPOINT - MORNING

Bob Anders presents a YELLOW ENTRY FORM to a rough-voiced 
Immigration Officer.

100.

IMMIGRATION OFFICER

(to Bob Anders)

When did you arrive in Iran?

BOB ANDERS

Two days ago. 

IMMIGRATION OFFICER

What was the purpose of your visit?

BOB ANDERS

We were looking at locations to 
make a film. I’m the director.

Immigration Officer pauses and looks up. Looks at the six 
other faces. He looks every bit as confrontational as Tony 
acted in rehearsal.

BOB ANDERS (CONT’D)

(very calm)

We have a letter from the Minister 
of Culture, if you’d like to see 
it.

The Immigration Officer gestures for the letter. Bob takes 
the letter inviting them on their location scout out of a 
folder. Tony, barely perceptibly, nods.

INT. KOMITEH OFFICE - MORNING

Moustache is now speaking with Khalkali. They speak Farsi and 
it’s untranslated, but we get it. He is showing the 
photograph of Mark Lijek from the bazaar and comparing it to 
the U.S. diplomatic photograph.

Khalkali picks up the phone.

INT. MEHRABAD AIRPORT, SECOND CHECKPOINT - MORNING

Immigration Official is conferring with Immigration Official 
2 as they look at the letter from the Minister of Culture. 
The Houseguests and Mendez wait. 

Cora Lijek breathes carefully, trying to stay composed. She’s 
twisting her wedding ring. She’s four months. It’s getting 
tight.

Finally Immigration Official 2 shrugs.

101.

IMMIGRATION OFFICER

Okay -- Yes -- Okay --

He waves them through. Second checkpoint done.

INT. CIA, LANGLEY - NIGHT

Malinov, a phone to his ear. Ringing.

MALINOV

C’mon c’mon c’mon --

INT. ARGO PRODUCTION OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON

The phone in the office rings. No one is there.

EXT. COLUMBIA STUDIOS, SUNSET AND GOWER - EVENING

Siegel and Chambers are walking back to the office carrying 
coffee, or maybe In and Out burger bags.

The artificial glow of Hollywood light in the near distance. 
They are within sight of the Argo bungalow, but a P.A. steps 
in front of them.

P.A.

(a stage whisper)

I’m sorry, we’re shooting.

He motions for them to wait. A movie -- it looks like a 
police procedural: a drunk cop, a redemption story -- is 
shooting on the lot between Siegel, Chambers, and the Argo 
office.

INT. AIRPORT GATE - MORNING

ANNOUNCEMENT

SwissAir announces general boarding 
for Flight 363 to Zurich.

Passengers, mostly European businessmen, get up and approach 
the gate.

INT. MEHRABAD AIRPORT, THIRD CHECKPOINT - MORNING

Mendez checks in with the Houseguests with his eyes. They are 
now in sight of the airport gates. And here are six Komiteh. 
Young men -- none more than 33 or so -- holding automatic 
weapons. 

They have created their own checkpoint. It looks recent, like 
the makeshift checkpoints after September 11th, A SCREENED-
OFF AREA WITH TABLES.

102.

KOMITEH 1

(in Farsi, then in 
English)

Passports.

He looks at the Canadian passports and then almost 
immediately speaks.

KOMITEH 1 (CONT’D)

You come.

He directs Mendez and the Houseguests into the screened-off 
area. Speaks in Farsi to another Komiteh.

INT. CIA, LANGLEY - NIGHT

LAMONT

(holding the phone)

Purser’s telling Swissair they’re 
not on the plane.

O’DONNELL

They should have boarded already.

MALINOV

(on another phone)

Still no answer in the L.A. office.

INT. MEHRABAD AIRPORT, THIRD CHECKPOINT - MORNING

MARK LIJEK

A film.

Mark mimes the Charlie Chaplin universal signal of turning 
the rotor of a movie camera. But it’s not universal. Komiteh 
1 doesn’t understand.

BEARDED KOMITEH (O.S.)

Sit down.

A young man with a beard -- probably late 20s -- speaks in 
very good American English. He looks at the six and the face 
he singles out is Joe Stafford’s.

BEARDED KOMITEH (CONT’D)

(harsh, icy)

You. You had no business in Iran.

He motions for JOE STAFFORD to step forward. Mendez shifts. A 
tense moment.

103.

JOE STAFFORD

We did. We were preparing to make a 
movie here, sir.

BEARDED KOMITEH

You don’t have journalist visas.

JOE STAFFORD

Not a documentary. A movie. 

Joe Stafford reaches into his pocket and gives Bearded 
Komiteh a copy of the Argo Variety ad.

JOE STAFFORD (CONT’D)

Kevin, where’s your briefcase?

You see? 

(to Mendez)

A beat on Mendez. Who then opens his accordion folder and 
takes from it the ARGO STORYBOARDS. Joe Stafford spreads them 
out on the table.

Three other Komiteh in the room -- who are about 21 -- lean 
forward, their AUTOMATIC WEAPONS at their sides, and look at 
the STORYBOARD DRAWINGS. The Persian Empire futurism of Jack 
Kirby’s drawings.

JOE STAFFORD (CONT’D)

These are the villains. Y’see these 
guys here? And these are the 
heroes... in the spice market...

Joe Stafford points at the various drawings. He speaks with 
an ease and confidence that we didn’t know he had. Kathy 
Stafford stares at her husband.

JOE STAFFORD (CONT’D)
They’re trying to get past the 
towers and into the city. They have 
these chariots ... like this one 
... they go like this ... whoooosh, 
hmm? They can fly ... 

Mendez watches. It’s a performance. The three young Komiteh 
are now wide-eyed, pointing, whispering in Farsi, like 
teenagers around a comic book.

Bearded Komiteh says something to another Komiteh in the 
room. Then --

104.

BEARDED KOMITEH

(to Joe Stafford)

You don’t go until we verify. 

MENDEZ

You can call our office.

Mendez hands Bearded Komiteh his card. STUDIO SIX FILMS. 
Kevin Harkins. A 213 phone number. 

ANGLES on the Houseguests as Bearded Komiteh leaves the room 
with the business card and three young Komiteh barely look up 
from the drawings --

EXT. COLUMBIA STUDIOS, SUNSET AND GOWER - LATE AFTERNOON

P.A., with one eye on the A.D., still holding Chambers and 
Siegel. The ACTOR playing the cop is conferring with the 
director. He’s not happy with something. They’re holding 
everyone until the next take, and --

P.A.

Going again please! We’re rolling --

EXT. CANADIAN AMBASSADOR’S RESIDENCE - MORNING

A PICK-UP TRUCK with 5 Komiteh -- automatic weapons out -- 
drives up to the Canadian Ambassador’s residence. 

Someone uses clippers to force the gate open.

INT. MEHRABAD AIRPORT, KOMITEH STATION - MORNING

Bearded Komiteh, who apparently has some authority here, 
enters, telling another Komiteh in Farsi to get off the 
phone. Bearded Komiteh looks at the Studio Six business card 
and picks up the receiver.

EXT. COLUMBIA STUDIOS, SUNSET AND GOWER - LATE AFTERNOON

SIEGEL

I’m sorry, pally. We’re just gonna 
be in the movie. Call my agent.

P.A.

Sir. SIR!

Siegel and Chambers walk through the shot toward the Argo 
office.

105.

INT. MEHRABAD AIRPORT, KOMITEH STATION - MORNING

Bearded Komiteh dials the long international number. And it 
is a DIAL, so this takes a long time.

INT. MEHRABAD AIRPORT, THIRD CHECKPOINT - MORNING

One of the young Komiteh is loudly debating with another 
Komiteh the air-worthiness of a futuristic desert glider in 
the storyboards.  He’s miming the thing crashing.

Joe Stafford and the Houseguests are silent. Mendez can see 
the line of passengers on their Swissair flight dwindling.

INT. MEHRABAD AIRPORT, KOMITEH STATION - MORNING

Bearded Komiteh rings the phone three times -- four times -- 
he’s going to hang up --

CHAMBERS (V.O.)

(out of breath)

Studio Six films.

INT. ARGO PRODUCTION OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON

A beat of silence. Chambers catching his breath, listening. 
The door to the office wide open.

INT. MEHRABAD AIRPORT, KOMITEH STATION - MORNING

BEARDED KOMITEH

May I speak to Mr. Kevin Harkins--

CHAMBERS (O.S.)

He’s out of the country on a 
location scout. May I take a 
message?

INT. ARGO PRODUCTION OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON

Chambers listens for a response. Siegel now catches up.

INT. MEHRABAD AIRPORT, KOMITEH STATION - MORNING

BEARDED KOMITEH

No message.

INT. MEHRABAD AIRPORT - MORNING

ANNOUNCEMENT

Swissair announces final boarding 
of Flight 363 to Zurich. All 
passengers should be at the gate at 
this time.

EXT. CANADIAN AMBASSADOR’S RESIDENCE - MORNING

Komiteh are forcing the front door of the house open.

INT. MEHRABAD AIRPORT, THIRD CHECKPOINT - MORNING

Bearded Komiteh comes back into the screened-off area. Looks 
at Joe Stafford, then at Mendez. Then says something in Farsi 
to the three Komiteh in the holding area. Then he leaves.

The three Young Komiteh look at the drawings, then at Joe 
Stafford. Silence for a moment.

MENDEZ

(he pushes the storyboards 
toward them)

Our gift to you. From our film.

Komiteh 1, who speaks enough English to understand, 
translates to the others. They forget their revolutionary 
mission for a second, happy with their gift. They’d high-five 
if they could. They’re kids.

Komiteh 1 motions for the Houseguests to go.

INT. CANADIAN AMBASSADOR’S RESIDENCE - MORNING

A dozen Komiteh, guns drawn, rush into the residence. Empty 
liquor bottles. The remains of what looks like breakfast for 
a group of people. 

But the place is empty. The Komiteh in a Jacket, who seems to 
be in charge, sends someone to check upstairs.

INT./EXT. MEHRABAD AIRPORT, FLIGHT GATE - MORNING

Outside, a BUSLOAD of passengers about to be ferried to the 
airplane.

A Swissair Rep is closing the gate to Flight 363. She looks 
up to see the Houseguests and Mendez hurrying through the 
terminal, headed toward her. She holds the gate, speaks in 
German into a walkie, and --

INT. CANADIAN AMBASSADOR’S RESIDENCE - MORNING

A Komiteh, upstairs, comes to the foyer balcony and shouts 
something in Farsi down to the Komiteh in a Jacket. Who picks 
up a phone on a hallway table and dials a number. 

107.

ANGLE ON

A SwissAir ticket is torn.

INT. MEHRABAD AIRPORT, FLIGHT GATE - MORNING

Cora Lijek’s ticket is taken and she walks through the door. 
Hurries toward the transport bus. The other five Houseguests 
and Mendez behind her and --

INT. MEHRABAD AIRPORT, KOMITEH STATION - MORNING

A phone rings and a Young Komiteh picks up the call. He 
listens for a moment. Then he drops the phone and RUNS into 
the airport terminal and --

INT. RUNWAY TRANSPORT BUS - MORNING

The Houseguests sit aboard the bus, headed to a waiting DC-
10. 

The DRIVER puts the bus into gear. It doesn’t go. He shakes 
his head. This goddamn thing.  Shifts gears again. Now it 
goes.

INT. MEHRABAD AIRPORT - MORNING

Young Komiteh RUNNING through the terminal, pushing through a 
crowd, making a Woman drop her suitcase, contents scattering. 
An automatic weapon at his side. 

The three Komiteh from the Third Checkpoint stand up from the 
table with the Argo storyboards. Young Komiteh shouts at them 
and they take up their weapons and join him, running --

EXT. SWISSAIR DC 10 - MORNING

The Houesguests head up the stairs to the plane.

INT. MEHRABAD AIRPORT, FLIGHT GATE - MORNING

The Young Komiteh arrives at Flight 363’s gate. The door is 
CLOSED. 

INT. SWISSAIR DC 10 - MORNING

The Houseguests put their carry-on luggage into the overhead 
bins. A Flight Attendant is already holding a detached 
seatbelt preparing to do her safety mime.

108.

ANNOUNCEMENT (GERMAN)

Please direct your attention to the 
flight attendants for some 
important safety information.

Mendez is sitting looking out the window toward the terminal.

ANGLE ON

The wheel of the DC-10. The airplane has now pulled away from 
the gate and is backing up toward the runway -- slowly -- 
maddeningly slow --

INT. SWISSAIR DC 10 - MORNING

Passengers read paperbacks or International Herald Tribunes. 
Mark Lijek’s arm is around Cora. Lee Schatz is moving his 
mouth in what looks like a prayer. Kathy Stafford’s fingers 
shake as she holds an arm rest. Joe Stafford tries to stay 
her hand.

INT. MEHRABAD AIRPORT, FLIGHT GATE - MORNING

The Young Komiteh yells to a Swissair Rep, dragging her back 
toward the gate. We can’t hear what she says back, but she’s 
shaking her head.

Young Komiteh goes to the WINDOW. He can see the Swissair 
plane slowly turning onto the runway. He picks up a walkie 
and pushes through the flight gate door, setting off an 
alarm, followed by the two other Komiteh.

INT. MEHRABAD FLIGHT TOWER - MORNING

An Iranian FLIGHT TRAFFIC CONTROLLER calmly speaks into his 
radio in British-accented English.

FLIGHT TRAFFIC CONTROLLER
SwissAir 363, you are Number 2 for 
departure.

109.

INT. SWISSAIR DC 10 - MORNING

Out the window of the plane. Two IRANIAN POLICE CARS and a 
CANVAS-TOPPED TRUCK are headed down the runway toward the 
plane.

It’s the POV of MENDEZ. Looking out from his window seat.

EXT. AIRPORT RUNWAY - MORNING

An IRAN AIRLINES 747 takes off, revealing the Swissair jet 
behind it. Only empty runway ahead of Swissair 363 now and --

ANGLE ON

Boots taking stairs two at a time.

INT. MEHRABAD FLIGHT TOWER - MORNING

Three Komiteh with automatics rush up the tower stairs --

EXT. AIRPORT RUNWAY - MORNING

We’re speeding behind two Iranian Police Cars and a Canvas 
Topped Jeep as they speed toward the Swissair plane. In the 
back of the jeep we can see half a dozen Komiteh, weapons 
drawn and --

INT. SWISSAIR DC 10, COCKPIT - MORNING

A SWISSAIR PILOT, 50s, at the controls.

VOICE OF FLIGHT CONTROLLER

Swissair 363 --

The Pilot puts his hand on the throttle control.

INT. MEHRABAD FLIGHT TOWER - MORNING

FLIGHT TRAFFIC CONTROLLER

-- you are cleared for take-off.

The Flight Traffic Controller moves his head-set mic away 
from his mouth to take a drink of very strong Iranian tea, 
and -- the door to the Control Room BURSTS OPEN. Three 
Komiteh with automatics, shouting instructions to the Traffic 
Controller, who spills his tea --

110.

INT. SWISSAIR DC 10 - MORNING

Mendez looking out the window -- the three Iranian vehicles 
speeding ahead -- they’re gaining on us -- but now we start 
to pull away from them -- leaving them behind -- beginning to 
RISE UP --

INT. MEHRABAD FLIGHT TOWER - MORNING

The Flight Controller has his arms up... through the floor-to-
ceiling windows of the tower, as three Komiteh watch a 
Swissair DC 10 angle upward and leave the ground ...

EXT. AIRPORT RUNWAY - MORNING

The Komiteh from the jeep are now standing on the runway 
watching the plane disappear. 

INT. CIA, LANGLEY - NIGHT

LAMONT

(taking off headphones)

We have wheels up. It’s --

He starts to punch the air. O’Donnell stays his arm.

ODONNELL

Not till they’ve cleared the 
border.

INT. SWISSAIR DC 10 - MORNING

The Houseguests -- holding their breath -- 

Mendez -- looking out the window -- scanning the air around 
the plane -- behind every cloud --

ANNOUNCEMENT

Ladies and gentlemen, it is our 
pleasure to announce that alcoholic 
beverages are now available, as we 
have cleared Iranian airspace. 

A high pitched scream -- 

The Houseguests, who shout and embrace and celebrate.  Bob 
Anders high-fives Lee Schatz, then the other Houseguests. 
Mark Lijek, crying, embraces Cora. 

Kathy Stafford is laughing. She kisses her husband’s hand.

Some of the other passengers look up from their newspapers, 
annoyed at this Canadian fuss.

INT. CIA, LANGLEY - NIGHT

All eyes watch Malinov, listening, headphone to one ear...

111.

MALINOV

They’re CLEAR!

Cheers in the CIA. O’Donnell throws papers in the air and 
embraces Malinov.

INT./EXT. ARGO PRODUCTION OFFICE - NIGHT

Siegel throws down a phone and rushes outside ... to where 
Chambers smokes. 

SIEGEL

OUUUT! THEY’RE OUT!

Chambers and Lester scream like kids who’ve just scored the 
game-winning touchdown. The P.A. tries to shush them.

INT. SWISSAIR DC 10 - MORNING

A mini-champagne bottle pops. The Houseguests are 
celebrating: New Year’s Eve and a Super Bowl victory party in 
a DC-10 aisle.

FIND Mendez, sitting alone, apart from the celebration. 
Looking out the window. Mendez turns to see that someone is 
standing in the aisle next to him. Joe Stafford. Tony looks 
up at Joe.

FLIGHT ATTENDANT (O.S.)

I’m sorry, sir. You need to sit 
down.

But Joe doesn’t pay attention to the Flight Attendant tapping 
him on the shoulder. He extends his hand to Mendez. Who takes 
it. A moment between them. Stafford nods at Mendez, and what 
he means is “You’re a good man.” Mendez nods back to him.

FLIGHT ATTENDANT (CONT’D)

Sir?

Joe goes back to his seat. 

HOLD on Tony Mendez. For a long time.

INT. ARGO PRODUCTION OFFICE - NIGHT

Drinking straight from a bottle of Beefeater. Pauses between 
each of these lines.

112.

SIEGEL

It’s history, is what it is. 
“History plays out first as farce, 
then as tragedy.”

CHAMBERS

The quote’s the other way around.

SIEGEL

Who said that again?

Marx.

Groucho?

Karl.

WE are the good guys!

Six down, fifty to go.

LAMONT

Call the New York Fucking 
Times. The CIA are the good

The Canadians are the good guys.

MALINOV

LAMONT

-- we’re not greedy -- them too --

MALINOV

Only. Canada takes the credit, or 
they’ll retaliate against the 
hostages. Great Satan wasn’t 
involved. No CIA. 

LAMONT

Is that right, Jack?

113.

O’DONNELL

Involved in what? We’re as 
surprised as anybody that the 
Canadians got our people out. Thank 
you, Canada. 

Jack raises a glass of scotch and takes a drink.

ARCHIVE FOOTAGE

A homemade sign that reads: THANK YOU CANADA!* (*homecoming 
ceremony for Houseguests 2/1980). Hundreds are gathered to 
welcome the six back.

TED KOPPEL

Finally, a sliver of really good 
news. Not, unfortunately, related 
to the 50 hostages but to six other 
Americans who’ve been hiding in the 
Canadian Embassy in Tehran for 
almost three months now.

*AMERICA HELD HOSTAGE, DAY 87, BROADCAST (1/29/80).

60s. (*A.H.H. 1/29/80)

FLORA MACDONALD

It was a simple operation, really.

INT. STATE DEPARTMENT, LOBBY - DAY

The Houseguests -- the ones we’ve seen throughout the film, 
not the real ones -- arrive in the State Department lobby. 
Television lights everywhere. 

TED KOPPEL (V.O.)

The six fled the country posing as 
Canadian diplomats. They simply 
walked away.

Camera flashes, wild cheers. Banners: WELCOME HOME CORA AND 
MARK! IDAHO LOVES YOU, LEE! It’s the first moment of national 
celebration since the beginning of the crisis. 

ARCHIVE FOOTAGE

IRANIAN FOREIGN MINISTER SADEQ GHOTBZADEH speaks angrily into 
a microphone.

SADEQ GHOTBZADEH*

INT. RURAL VIRGINIA HOUSE - DAY

Christine Mendez is watching the scene on t.v. Michael next 
to her reading a Choose Your Own Adventure book. 

HOLD on Christine  watching the celebration. She doesn’t know 
her husband was involved. Or maybe she does know.

INT. CIA, LANGLEY - DAY

Mendez walks down the long windowed hall of the first floor.

SIEGEL (V.O.)

This morning my waitress at Jerry’s 
said to me, “You hear what those 
Canadians did? 

INT. SIEGEL’S LIVING ROOM - DAY

Lester in a bathrobe. The New York Times in front of him: SIX 
U.S. DIPLOMATS, HIDDEN BY CANADA, LEAVE IRAN SAFELY. Next to 
that, an article about Ken Taylor: DIPLOMAT DIRECTED ESCAPE 
IN IRAN.  (Front page, *NYT 1/30/80). 

SIEGEL

She said, “Why couldn’t we pull off 
something like that?” You know what 
I said to her? 

INT. CIA, LANGLEY - DAY

Mendez at his desk, a pile of messages near him.

MENDEZ

Wha’d you say to her?

115.

INT. SIEGEL’S LIVING ROOM - DAY

SIEGEL

I said “Argo fuck yourself.”

INT. CIA ARCHIVES - DAY

And suddenly it’s dead-quiet. We’re in a vault inside a vault 
in the basement of the main building.

Mendez’s suitcase is lying on a low counter, an ARCHIVES 
OFFICER toe-tagging and cataloging various items. Separating 
Mendez’s personal things from material related to the 
operation.

Mendez empties his briefcase and Officer puts a sticker on 
the VARIETY featuring the ARGO ad. Another on the ARGO 
script. He’s putting things into a box that reads: USCIA 
CLASSIFIED MATERIAL.

Mendez opens his accordion folder -- flips through it -- it’s 
empty -- no. There’s something inside. 

In one of the compartments is a STORYBOARD FROM ARGO. 

One that the komiteh missed. While the Archives Officer is 
turned around, Mendez slips the storyboard back into the 
accordion folder and puts it back with his personal things.

INT. CIA, HALLWAY - AFTERNOON

O’Donnell is on his way out. Seeing Mendez, he stops dead. 

O’DONNELL

And I sent my autograph book to the 
cleaners.

EXT. CIA, PARKING LOT - AFTERNOON

O’DONNELL

His Eminence called me. He wants to 
see you.

MENDEZ

He wants to fire me himself.

O'DONNELL

He wants to give you the 
Intelligence Star. 

(MORE)

O'DONNELL (CONT'D)

You’re getting the highest award of 
merit of the Clandestine Services 
of these fifty United States. 
Ceremony’s two weeks from today.

Mendez stops walking. A beat.

116.

MENDEZ

If they do it next week, Michael 
will be on winter break.

O'DONNELL

The op was classified so the 
ceremony’s classified. He can’t 
know about it. Nobody can know 
about it.

MENDEZ

They’re gonna hand me an award, 
then they’re gonna take it back?

O’DONNELL

If we wanted applause, we would 
have joined the circus.

MENDEZ

I thought that’s what we did.

O’Donnell claps Tony on the shoulder. They walk toward their 
separate cars.

O'DONNELL

(yelling to Tony; an 
afterthought)

Carter said you were a great 
American.

MENDEZ

(yelling back)

A great American what?

O’DONNELL
That he didn’t say. 

ANGLE ON

A POSTER on the wall. ARGO: A COSMIC CONFLAGRATION.

INT. ARGO PRODUCTION OFFICE - DAY

A hand takes the poster down. Chambers is disassembling the 
office. Boxes packed. Everything now off the walls.

He turns out the lights.

117.

EXT. COLUMBIA BACKLOT, SUNSET AND GOWER - AFTERNOON

Doug, the maintenance man who rented them the place, is 
watering a planter. He spots Chambers walking past with arms 
full of boxes, posters, an unopened bottle of Beefeater.

DOUG

You’re moving out?

Chambers gives the bottle to Doug, slaps his back.

DOUG (CONT’D)

What happened to Argo?

CHAMBERS
It’s in turnaround.

He’s walking away from us, through the backlot where a crane 
is moving into place for a night shoot.

EXT. ROAD UP TO RURAL VIRGINIA HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON

A Ford Bronco heads up the road, past a mailbox, toward a 
1920s farmhouse at the edge of the woods.

EXT. RURAL VIRGINIA HOUSE - 

Mendez, a duffel bag on his shoulder, knocks on the door. He 
waits. After a moment, Christine -- red sauce on her hands, 
in the middle of making dinner -- opens the door with a dish 
towel.

MENDEZ

CHRISTINE

Hi.

Hi.

CHRISTINE (CONT’D)

Before she can finish, he’s embraced her. Holds tight. It’s 
something in between romantic and fraternal. Not 
reconciliation, necessarily, but warmth. She reciprocates. It 
feels right, and good.

WIDEN to hold on them holding each other in dark the hall of 
the very American, even Hummel-kitschy, house. HOLD there for 
a while.

ANGLE ON

118.

A scene of the Old West on a television.

INT. RURAL VIRGINIA HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Michael is watching 1973’s sci-fi Western ‘Westworld’ in the 
living room. Michael doesn’t have to describe the scene to 
his father this time. Widen to see that his head is on a 
pillow on Tony’s lap.

Card 1: THE IRAN HOSTAGE CRISIS ENDED ON JANUARY 20, 1981, 
WHEN THE REMAINING EMBASSY HOSTAGES WERE RELEASED AFTER 444 
DAYS IN CAPTIVITY.

INT. MICHAEL’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

We can faintly hear the sounds of gunslinging from the living 
room movie in here. Glow-in-the-dark stars on the wall. A 
Star Wars X-Wing fighter. A couple of rubber Planet of the 
Apes figures that look like they’ve been chewed by a dog.

Card 2: OSCAR-WINNING MAKE-UP ARTIST JOHN CHAMBERS WAS 
AWARDED THE CIA’S INTELLIGENCE MEDAL OF MERIT, ITS HIGHEST 
CIVILIAN HONOR. HE REMAINED FRIENDS WITH TONY UNTIL CHAMBERS  
DIED IN 2001.

The camera moves over the dresser of Michael’s toys until we 
find, almost unnoticeable among his science fiction 
collection, a piece of cardboard behind Captain Kirk and Han 
Solo figures. 

It’s a STORYBOARD FROM ARGO. The one missed by the komiteh at 
the airport. 

Card 3: TONY MENDEZ WAS NOT GIVEN BACK HIS INTELLIGENCE STAR 
UNTIL 1997, WHEN THE ‘ARGO’ OPERATION WAS DECLASSIFIED BY 
PRESIDENT CLINTON. 

Linger on the ARGO STORYBOARD. A MAN in a futuristic chariot 
sheltering a KID from what look like laser beams. 

Card 4: HE LIVES IN RURAL MARYLAND WITH HIS FAMILY.

FADE TO BLACK. 

THE END.
