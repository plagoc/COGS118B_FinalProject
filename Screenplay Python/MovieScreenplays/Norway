I’ve started with your personal 
connection to the island. How it 
inspired your activism, and then 
you push on to the issues...

PRIME MINISTER

(scanning)

OK…  I think it needs to be a bit 
more personal. More about my 
memories of the camp. And then I 
want to really address the 
challenge of youth unemployment. 
Can you get the latest stats over 
to me tonight, and I’ll re-draft 
and bring it in tomorrow. 

PM AIDE 2 OYSTEIN

Yep.

PRIME MINISTER

(to AIDE 3)

OK, good morning everyone... Today

you do - change about the world. 
Viljar you can start.

VILJAR laughs and then goes up to the stage.

VILJAR

OK, so in Svalbard everyone is 
welcome, regardless of nationality. 
We’ve got Norwegians, Russians, 
Chinese, Croatians. All living and 
working together.

Yes, but you only have a couple

INT. PM’S RESIDENCY - STUDY - DAY 

19

PM STOLTENBERG is mid-way through a security briefing with: 
THE PST DIRECTOR, SECURITY OFFICIAL LARS, PM AIDE 2 OYSTEIN 
and SECURITY OFFICIAL 2 ENDRE.

PST DIRECTOR

Unrest in the Middle East 
continues. More Islamist terror, of 
course. But our main issue is going 
to be the resulting refugee crisis. 
The UNHCR is now forecasting a 
massive surge in migrant numbers 
trying to reach Europe.

Angle on the document: huge migrant figures from the Middle 
East and North Africa.

PRIME MINISTER

Potentially what - several million 
over the next five years?

AIDE OYSTEIN

Easily. It depends on political 
instability in the Middle East. 
Syria etc..

PRIME MINISTER

And the challenge is going to be 
how we protect inclusive domestic 
policies with numbers like these.

SECURITY OFFICIAL LARS

And it’s going to hit us right as 
we deal with the fallout from the 
banking crisis.

PRIME MINISTER
That’s right. Exactly....

VILJAR still in the seminar.

AUF MEMBER 2

What - you’d have open borders as 
Prime Minister?

VILJAR

No. I’m just saying whether we like 
it or not, the world is on the 
move. We’re part of a global 
system. Better to shape it, than 
pretend to pull up drawbridges that 
we can’t sustain.

It’s bad.

AIDE MARIT

Is this gas? A gas explosion?

AIDE OYSTEIN

That’s not a gas explosion, that’s 
a bomb. It’s got to be a bomb.

On PM as he surveys pictures of the damage. On air 
speculation about the status of the government. 

SECURITY OFFICIAL LARS

(enters, to comms)

Can we get an update on security at 
the Residency please? 

PRIME MINISTER

This is obviously a terrorist 
attack. We need to secure 
government. Call the cabinet. I 
want the Police Director, the Head 
of Defense and the PST. Get in 
contact with them now. And then we 
need to inform the King: The Prime 
Minister is safe, the government is 
functioning.

As you’ve probably heard, there’s

And defending me will be the

FEMALE DETECTIVE

(as she sits)

Mr Breivik, my name is Detective 
Anderson. I am a detective at the 
Homicide and Serious Crimes Unit. 
My job is to get as much 
information as possible about what 
happened today. Do you understand 
you’ve been arrested in connection 
with the explosion in Oslo, and the 
shooting on Utøya Island?

BREIVIK

Yes, of course. 

DETECTIVE ANDERSON 

Can you tell me how you planned 
these attacks?

BREIVIK

I can tell you 98%. I’ve been 
planning this for a long time. Two 
years ago I decided to take action. 
I sold my digital businesses. I 
bought a farm and devoted myself to 
the mission. Mental training. 
Physical training. Regular target 
practice. Honing my skills. Buying 
supplies. Carrying out 
reconnaissance. 

DETECTIVE ANDERSON 

What about the bomb?

BREIVIK

I built it myself. Everything I 
needed was online. Do you want me 
to go into detail? That’s going to 
take hours. It was a lot of work. 

DETECTIVE ANDERSON 

Did anyone help you? 

BREIVIK

I am just one cog in a network. The 
Knight’s Templar Europe. Named in 
honour of the Knights of the 
Crusade. Our organisation was set 
up in London in 2002 with delegates 
from 12 countries. We want Islam 
out of Europe. 

DETECTIVe ANDERSON 

Can you give me any other names?

BREIVIK

Of course not. 

DETECTIVE ANDERSON

We have found your computer, at 
your mother’s apartment. Can you 
tell me what’s on it?

My manifesto. 1500 pages. It 
explains everything.

You sent it to 8,000 people. Did 
any of them help you?

They are sympathisers. 

DETECTIVE ANDERSON

Did any of them assist you?

No answer. 

DETECTIVE ANDERSON (CONT’D)

I need to know if any more attacks 
are planned.

BREIVIK

This is a war. Attacks can come at 
any moment. But you need to agree 
to my demands.

DETECTIVE ANDERSON

This isn’t a negotiation. 

BREIVIK

I don’t believe you’re in a 
position to dictate terms, 
Detective. 

DETECTIVE ANDERSON

Haven’t enough people died? I need 
to know if there are any more 
attacks coming. 

BREIVIK

I’d like to break now. I’ve been

since you arrested me.

He shows a small cut on his finger.

We are all shocked. This was an 
attack on our government, and on 
our children. We are a long way 
from understanding why. But what is 
clear is that our nation has been 
attacked by someone who would see 
it changed...

As he speaks, we begin a montage of archive: Norway responds. 
The Cathedral, the Rose March, the first funerals attended by 
thousands. The PM embracing SURVIVORS, PARENTS, COMMUNITY 
LEADERS including MUSLIMS. Grief, love and unity.

...He would see our democracy 
become tyranny. See our humanity 
fall... We must not give in to this 
terror. We must fight. But we must 
not become changed. Instead, we 
must strengthen our values. We must 
fight this terror with the rule of 
law, not the barrel of the gun. We 
must answer the hate of the few, 
with love the of the many. Only 
then will it be beaten…

himself.

from theatre. 

LEAD SURGEON

Viljar’s in recovery. I’m afraid we 
couldn’t get all the shrapnel. It 
was too deep. We’ll have to wait 
for him to wake up, before we can 
assess the damage. Our concern 
right now is infection. We’ve put 
him on some strong antibiotics, and 
we’re monitoring him closely. But 
there’s nothing more we can do for 
Viljar now. He needs to wake up.

VIBEKE DEF. LAWYER (V.O.)
It was a very dysfunctional family. 
Breivik’s parents split 
acrimoniously when he was very 
young.

Insert: LIPPESTAD looks at ABB’s SOCIAL SERVICES FILES. 

VIBEKE DEF LAWYER

His mother couldn’t cope. She wrote 
to Social Services asking for help. 
They put Breivik under psychiatric 
observation. They had serious 
doubts about his mother’s capacity 
to parent.

It was just him and his mother 
after that.

No, not it’s not.

LIPPESTAD

My name is Geir Lippestad. I’ve 
been appointed by your son to lead 
his defence. Now I know Anders 
doesn’t have a relationship with 
his father. So I wanted to ask you 
some questions. We need to decide 
how to build his case.

BREIVIK’S MOTHER

Yes, of course.

LIPPESTAD

What was Anders like as a child?

BREIVIK’S MOTHER

He was a normal boy. Kind, clever 
Lots of friends. He loved his 
mother. I was a single parent after 
his father left us, but I made sure 
he had a normal childhood. We had a 
very nice house.

LIPPESTAD

Did he have any medical conditions?  
Any mental health issues?

BREIVIK’S MOTHER

Oh no. 

LIPPESTAD
Was he ever violent?

BREIVIK’S MOTHER

Never. He loved me. He loved 
affection. 

LIPPESTAD

Did you have any dealings with 
social services?

He sees her hands shaking. She’s on the edge.

That was nothing. Welfare state

was fine.

LIPPESTAD

I see.

(beat)

Did you have any sense recently 
that Anders was having problems? 

BREIVIKS MOTHER

No. 

(beat)

I told the police that I saw he had 
guns in his bedroom. But he told me 
he needed them for hunting. I 
believed him. 

LIPPESTAD

Would you consider testifying in 
Anders’ defense?

BREIVIKS MOTHER

What would I say?

LIPPESTAD

Just that there were problems. In 
his childhood. It would help him.

BREIVIK’S MOTHER

But then everyone will know. 

LIPPESTAD

Anders is entitled to a defense, 
just like everyone else. 

BREIVIKS MOTHER

But I’ll be the most hated mother 
in Norway.

LIPPESTAD
Please consider it.

LIPPESTAD goes to the door.

BREIVIK’S MOTHER

He’s sort of right though, isn’t 
he. About the way the country is

PRIME MINISTER

The elections will go ahead as 
scheduled. It is important that our 
democratic process continues as 
normal.  

REPORTER 2

Do you honestly feel we can have 
elections so soon after the 
attacks? When there is so much 
anger?

PRIME MINISTER

We’re being tested as never before. 
In our courts. In our hearts, and 
in our minds. We have to trust our 
system. Trust that it will find a 
way to bring us through safely. 
Together. And I believe it will.

Ms Larsen, how do the families feel 
about Breivik’s insanity plea? 

FAMILY LAWYER

I can say on behalf of my clients, 
that they strongly oppose Mr. 
Breivik’s psychiatric diagnosis, 
and as the coordinating lawyer for 
the families and survivors of the 
22nd July attacks, I will be 
petitioning the court today to 
order further assessments. We 
demand that Mr. Breivik face 
justice and be held accountable for

LIPPESTAD sits in front of a white man (40s). 

LIPPESTAD

My client Anders Breivik writes 
about you in his manifesto. He 
obviously admires you. 

EXTREMIST

Many people admire me. But it’s not 
me they admire. It’s my ideas about 
the world.  

LIPPESTAD

Did you ever meet him?

EXTREMIST

He asked. But I’m careful who I 
work with. What I do, who I meet.

(beat)

He’s not from round here you know. 
He’s from your end of town. But 
yes, we share the same vision for 
the world.

LIPPESTAD

He says a war is coming.

EXTREMIST

I’d say it’s already started... 

LIPPESTAD

Are you a member of the Knight’s 
Templar?

EXTREMIST

There are many other organisations.

LIPPESTAD

The Nordic Resistance Movement?

EXTREMIST

All across Scandinavia. Northern 
Europe. We’re strong in eastern 
Europe too of course. Very strong 
in the UK too. New groups forming 
all the time. 

LIPPESTAD

How about America?

EXTREMIST

Stormfront. Growing fast. Very 
fast. And joining up with us here 
in Europe.  

LIPPESTAD

How do you communicate?

EXTREMIST

Where you can’t see us. In chat 
rooms. The Dark Web. Lippestad, 
with every al-Qaeda attack, we grow 
in strength. Every migrant boat 
that crosses the Med, more people 
join. There’s a lot of fear and 
anger out there... And that’s why, 
tomorrow will belong to us. 

That hangs there.

Follow CHRISTIN towards a room, crowded with PARENTS and 
their LAWYERS. She pauses outside. Hears a loud argument in 
progress. She opens the door and slips into the back as the 
argument rages.

PARENT 1

I just don’t see how it can be 
right that he’s allowed to speak. 
My daughter can’t leave her bedroom 
because of him. He broke her, and 
now he gets to stand up there and 
tell us how he did it. 

FAMILY LAWYER

The court has to observe his 
rights.

PARENT 1

But he doesn’t deserve rights!

PARENT 2

He’s trying to use this trial as a 
platform for his propaganda. 

FAMILY LAWYER

I will be there to ensure that 
doesn’t happen.  

PARENT 2

But it is happening. That’s exactly 
what he’s doing. 

FAMILY LAWYER

Look, the judge is letting us bring 
our own psychiatric experts, and 
we’re closing the trial with victim 
impact statements-

PARENT 3

They should just hang him. 

FAMILY LAWYER

Listen, I promise you, we will have 
our chance to-

PARENT 3 

But it’s not enough! This isn’t 
justice! They should just string 
him up. Be done with it. 

See CHRISTIN. Finally she can’t take it anymore.

(to everyone)

Our children won’t get justice by

(beat)

I know you’re angry. I’m angry too. 
And my sons came back. Many of your 
children didn’t. But we can’t 
surrender to our anger, no matter 
how much we feel it. Somehow we 
have to learn to trust the world 
again. To trust each other. We have 
to reconnect. And that begins when 
we walk into that courtroom.

(beat)

Our power will come from how we 
respond to this man. Not in how we 
silence him. We have to trust in 
justice. That’s the only way we’ll 
win.

INGA

(stands)

On 22 July 2011, Anders Behring 
Breivik carried out a dual terror 
attack taking the lives of 77 
innocent people. Hundreds more were 
injured and left forever scarred by 
his actions. The facts are clear. 
First the car bomb, then the mass 
shooting. There is over-whelming 
evidence, including his own signed 
confession. 
(pauses)

So the question is not whether he 
committed the crime, the question 
is how should he be judged?

Your Honour, the law is clear. If 
there is any doubt about the sanity 
of a person accused, we are 
required by law to request 
treatment. Not imprisonment. 

LIPPESTAD watches the PARENTS, as they impassively listen.

INGA (CONT’D)

Given the court-ordered, 
psychiatric diagnosis, the 
Prosecution believes there is 
clearly significant doubt as to 
Anders Behring Breivik’s state of 
mind on 22nd July. Therefore, we 
request the court to find him 
guilty, but sentence him to 
mandatory psychiatric treatment in 
a secure facility.

INGA sits. The JUDGE nods to LIPPESTAD.

LIPPESTAD

(standing)

Your Honour, we will not seek to 
deny the crimes committed on July 
22nd. However, we will argue that 
Mr. Breivik was not psychotic 
during these attacks. Instead, we 
say he knew exactly what he was 
doing. 

(feels Breivik’s eyes on 
him)

And though it is difficult to 
comprehend Anders Breivik’s view of 
the world, we will show that he is 
not alone in his opinions. There 
are others who think the way he 
does. Increasing numbers of people, 
all over the west. His were 
political acts.

(his opening statement)

I stand here today on behalf of 
Europeans who are being deprived of 
their ethnic, indigenous, cultural, 
and territorial rights. 

The Prosecution tell you I am 
insane. They do this because they 
fear me. Because I have committed 
the most sophisticated, the most 
spectacular, political 
assassination in Europe since World 
War Two.

(beat, he turns a page)

And why? Because Norway, Europe. 
These are not real democracies. Is 
it democratic for a nation not to 
be consulted about whether it 
becomes multicultural? To fail to 
ask your people for permission 
before welcoming immigrants? To 
force them to become a minority in 
their own capital? There can be no 
democracy whilst the liberal elites 
in Europe are in power. Democratic 
struggle is pointless. Many will 
realise this in the coming decades 
and pick up arms. Just as I did.    

He turns the page.

GJØRV

Thank you for coming today, Prime 
Minister. 
(beat)

I want to begin by exploring to 
what extent Government was aware of 
the threat posed by Anders Behring 
Breivik prior to his attacks on 
22nd July. 

PRIME MINISTER

The Security Services told me they 
had no warnings. He operated 
completely out of sight. 

GJORV

He could not have been detected in 
advance?

PRIME MINISTER

That is my understanding. Yes. 

GJORV

Prime Minister, our investigation 
has discovered that Mr. Breivik’s 
purchase of chemicals used in the 
preparation of the bomb came to the 
attention of the customs service in 
January 2011. But this was not 
acted upon by the Security 
Services.

That is not what I was told, Madam 
Chair.

were proposals discussed inside 
government to improve physical 
security around the Prime 
Minister’s Office. 

The PM reads.

GJØRV

Were you aware of these 
discussions?

PRIME MINISTER

In general terms. Yes. 

GJORV

So can I ask you why Government did 
not act?

PRIME MINISTER

There were delays. Concerns that 
Oslo’s city centre would become a 
closed area. We did not want our 
Government cut off from the people. 

(Beat)

It was a mistake. Clearly.

GJØRV

I see.

If mistakes were made, they were 
made in good faith. In the most

Mr Breivik, can I ask you about the

BREIVIK

The Knights Templar are a network. 
Patriots, who think the way I do 
and are willing take up arms just 
as I did, in order to defend their 
way of life.

INGA

How big is this network?

BREIVIK

We have members in every country. 
All across the West.

Mr. Breivik, you told police that 
this organisation was set up in 
London in 2002. Is that true?

Yes. After 9/11.

Did you attend this first meeting?

I did.

And what happened?

But now it is no longer a secret, 
can you prove this meeting actually 
took place?

Can you tell me the names of those

No comment.

The names of anyone in the Knights 
Templar?

BREIVIK

I will not betray my brothers.

INGA

Mr. Breivik, it will help your case 
if you can give us some, any, 
evidence that the Knights Templar 
actually exists.

BREIVIK

(with steel)

Here is the problem in society 
today. Clearly exposed. You say I 
am mad because I tell you many 
people out there think and feel as 
I do. About immigrants. About 
multiculturalism. But is it my 
madness or are you, the liberal 
elites, so out of touch that you 
don’t want to hear what we are

RADIO REPORTER (OOV)
There is no doubt that Anders 
Breivik is in control. He’s using 
the trial for his own purposes... 

Finally VILJAR’s legs buckle. 

VILJAR on his hands and knees. Pushes himself up again.

LIPPESTAD is cross-examining BREIVIK now.

CUT TO:

LIPPESTAD

Mr Breivik, can you describe your 
preparations for the attacks? 

BREIVIK

I was meticulous. First, I sold my 
assets. Then I carefully began to 
assemble the components of the 
bomb. I did it very slowly of 
course, so the authorities wouldn’t 
see me.

 LIPPESTAD

Can you give me an example?

BREIVIK

Yes. A component of the bomb is 
found in aspirin tablets. I knew it 
would raise red flags if I 
attempted to buy too many packs at 
one time. So I created a purchasing 
route, which covered twenty drug-
stores. It took me four hours to 
complete. On foot.

BREIVIK (CONT'D)

I then waited seven to fourteen 
days before I began the route 
again. Month after month. Two packs 
at a time. I was very careful. 

LIPPESTAD

Would you say you can feel empathy?

BREIVIK

(beat)

Yes. I’m a normal person. I’m sane. 
There is a distinction between 
political extremism and insanity. 
They are very different things. 

However, I needed a lot of mental 
preparation for this mission. I 
knew these attacks would be highly 
violent. There was a risk that, 
through empathy, I might lose my 
nerve. So I learned an ancient form 
of meditation. To control my 
emotions. I used it during the 
attacks, and I’m using it right 
now.

(beat)

Shall I make this easier for you 
all? I will forego any appeal, any 
re-trial, spare the families all 
for this, if the court finds me 
sane.

What happened. The truth.

VILJAR

What that I cry in my sleep? That I 
can’t talk to strangers? That I’m

go than let him hear that. 

CHRISTIN

The truth doesn’t make you weak.

VILJAR

It doesn't make me feel strong.

SVEINN

What is it you want?

VILJAR

I want to smash him. Smash him to a 
bloody pulp. Smash his face in. For 
what he did to everyone. To Simon

LIPPESTAD cross-examines the FAR-RIGHT EXTREMIST. BREIVIK

LIPPESTAD

How long have you been active in 
the politics of the Far-Right in 
Norway?

EXTREMIST
My whole adult life.

LIPPESTAD

And you share Mr. Breivik’s 
opinions on the subject of 
immigration?

EXTREMIST

I do.

LIPPESTAD

And you agree with him that 
multiculturalism is a threat to 
Europe?

EXTREMIST

Absolutely.

LIPPESTAD

Are you aware of others who share 
these opinions?

EXTREMIST

Many people. I would say millions. 
Wouldn’t you?

See BREIVIK, vindicated.

LIPPESTAD

Have you ever met the Defendant?

EXTREMIST

I’ve met him online. 

LIPPESTAD

Online?

EXTREMIST

In chat forums, attached to mythic, 
military games like World of 
Warcraft. Call of Duty. Our 
movement often congregates there.

He liked to lead missions online. 
To strategise.

Was he a leader?

EXTREMIST

He certainly wanted to be.  

LIPPESTAD

I have no more questions.

INGA stands, to begin the Prosecution’s cross-examination.  

INGA

Was Mr. Breivik your leader?

EXTREMIST

No. 

INGA

You wouldn’t follow Mr. Breivik?

Right. Whatever you want to call 
us.

We’re deadly serious. About seizing 
power. Changing society completely. 
About total victory.

Not singular, violent acts that 
don’t contribute to that goal. The 
tide of history is flowing our way 
again. Nothing must get in its way.

See BREIVIK watching intently. 

INGA

So I’ll repeat the question. Would 
you, holding your views - the same 
views as Mr. Breivik - have done 
what he did?

She waits.

No. I would not.

FAMILY LAWYER

Dr. Toov. Please can you outline 
your qualifications for the court?

FIRST PSYCHIATRIC WITNESS

I’m a Professor of Psychiatry. I 
have over 30 years of clinical 
experience. Both here in Norway and 
abroad. And I have studied 
carefully the various psychiatric 
assessments of Mr. Breivik, carried 
out in prison.

FAMILY LAWYER

In your expert opinion, can you 
give the court your assessment of 
Mr. Breivik’s state of mind, when 
he carried out the attacks on the 
22 July?

FIRST PSYCHIATRIST WITNESS

It is my opinion that Mr. Breivik 
suffers from a severe personality 
disorder. But there is no evidence 
of clinical psychosis. Of insanity. 

See BREIVIK, vindicated.

FIRST PSYCHIATRIST WITNESS (CONT’D)

Of course, Mr. Breivik is a man who 
lives in a fantasy world. He makes 
up stories to inflate his own 
importance. Stories about the 
Knights Templar, for instance, 
which clearly does not exist. But 
these grandiose claims are not 
delusions. They are lies. Just 
that. Lies. 

FAMILY LAWYER

Lies?

FIRST PSYCHIATRIST WITNESS
Yes. Lies about himself and the way 
the world is. Lies to try to 
recruit people to his side. To 
elevate himself out of his own 
insignificance. Put simply, he lies 
as a defense mechanism. To make 
himself appear less of the failure 
that inside he feels himself to be.

FAMILY LAWYER

So how would you categorise Mr. 
Breivik?

FIRST PSYCHIATRIST WITNESS

In an attempt to categorise the 
Defendant, to make sense of him, I 
believe we are missing the point 
entirely. The truth is simple. 
Anders Behring Breivik feels 
rejected by society. Unloved, 
ignored, forgotten, and deeply, 
deeply lonely. And all his 
overwhelming anger flows from this. 

BREIVIK
(on his feet)

This is offensive!! It’s lies! All 
lies!

JUDGE ARNTZEN

Mr. Breivik, please sit down. 

BREIVIK

(finally losing control)

I’ve never failed at anything! Not 
one thing in my entire life! I’m 
not alone. I have many friends! I 
have never been rejected!

JUDGE ARNTZEN

Mr. Lippestad, please ask your 
client to sit down. 

BREIVIK
(to LIPPESTAD)

You have to stop this. You’re my 
lawyer. You’re supposed to protect 
me.

LIPPESTAD

They have the right to do this. To 
submit their own witnesses.

LIPPESTAD

If you want to be found sane, you 
must submit to the system.

LIPPESTAD watches LARA testify to FAMILY LAWYER.

LARA

My big sister Bano and I fled Iraq 
in 1999. We were refugees. My 
father brought us to Norway to be 
safe.  When I came from Kurdistan - 
what you call Iraq - I was just 
five years old. I was a refugee. It 
took a long time for Norway to feel 
like home. I struggled with the 
language. The climate too. And some 
people were suspicious of us. Angry 
that we were here. 

LIPPESTAD looks at BREIVIK. No reaction.

LARA (CONT’D)

But my sister Bano helped me. To 
see that in Norway there could be 
freedom, security, and hope. And 
that is what I felt around the 
campfire on Utøya. The night 
before. 

(pauses)

But the next day, when we were 
attacked - when she died - I lost 
all that. I was suddenly in a 
different world. Of pain and fear. 
Anger.

(holding back her tears)

I felt guilty. All of the time. Why 
did I live when she died? How do I 
face my parents now? But most of 
all, I couldn’t understand why 
someone would want to kill us.

For a moment, VILJAR feels himself going back to the island. 
The sounds of terror and pain. That dark menacing FIGURE 
looming above him... 

He struggles for control. Forces himself not to go there. 
Holds BREIVIK’S empty stare for the longest moment. 

FAMILY LAWYER (CONT’D)
Can you tell us what happened to 
you on Utøya, Viljar?

VILJAR

Yes. He tried to... He tried to 
kill me.

(begins to remember)

I remember running away. Trying to 
find somewhere to hide. Trying to 
protect my little brother. And I 
remember being shot.

(using his right hand)

He shot me here, here, here, here, 
and finally here. In the eye. Five 
times. I lay on the beach. I was 
all alone. In a kind of pain I 
could never imagine. 

BREIVIK looks up momentarily. Catches VILJAR’s eye.

FAMILY LAWYER

But you’re here now?

VILJAR steels himself, keeping his emotion at bay. 

VILJAR

Yes. But everything is different. 
I’ve had to relearn how to use my 
body. Learn to walk again, to feed 
myself again. I have little use of 
my left arm. I’m blind in one eye - 
but that’s a relief.

And VILJAR sees it. Knows he’s got through. LIPPESTAD sees 
too.

VILJAR (CONT’D)

But of course it’s not that simple,  
I have a fragment of his bullet 
lodged in my brain, that could kill 
me at any time. 

His voice falters.

VILJAR (CONT’D)

And I don’t look like the person I 
used to. My body. It’s broken. 
Beyond repair. My self-confidence 
too. And I have pain that never 
goes away. 

A beat and then:

VILJAR (CONT’D)

Worst of all, he killed Anders and 
Simon. My best friends. Stopping 
them from making their mark on the 
world. They would have made it a 
better place. I miss them every 
day.

VILJAR stops, swallowing back his pain, trying to keep 
control. Head down. EVERYONE watching him. Becoming tearful.

VILJAR (CONT’D)

I’m sorry, I didn’t want to cry. I 
so much didn’t want to cry in front 
of him. I wanted to be strong. 
Because I do this for them. So they 
will not be forgotten. 

VILJAR looks up, right at BREIVIK. Tears, but an unwavering 
stare.

VILJAR (CONT’D)

When he shot them and left me alone 
on the beach, I didn’t know if I 
was living or dying. And I’ve been 
stuck there ever since. 

On BREIVIK, looking right back at him.

VILJAR (CONT’D)

But now I realise I’ve got a 
choice. I still have a family. And 
friends. And memories. Hopes, 
dreams, and love. 

(beat)

(beat)

And he doesn’t. He’s completely 
alone. He’s going to rot in prison, 
whereas I...

I survived and I choose to live.

And at that moment, BREIVIK looks away. LIPPESTAD sees it. 
And VILJAR sees it too. 

When BREIVIK looks back, they lock eyes again. VILJAR knows 
he’s won and BREIVIK knows it too. 

VILJAR (CONT’D)

(to the JUDGE)

I’m done.

JUDGE

Do the Defense have any questions?

LIPPESTAD

(standing)
No questions. 

Thank you.

(he turns to VILJAR)

VILJAR leaves the witness box. Sees LARA as he passes. 

Out of the courtroom and into the light.

LIPPESTAD sees BREIVIK watching them, as VILJAR is embraced 
by his PARENTS and TORJE.

FADE TO BLACK:

INT. MOD - PM’S OFFICE - DAY

246

PM alone, reading through the 22nd July Inquiry Report. The 
weight of it written into his face.

AIDE

The families are waiting for you, 
Sir. 

247

EXT. INQUIRY HQ - SAME TIME 

139.

CUT TO:

247

INQUIRY HEAD GJØRV comes out to address a waiting bank of 
PRESS.

GJØRV

Our conclusions are clear. There 
were failings on and before the 
attacks of 22 July. The failure to 
detect Anders Breivik’s activities 
at an earlier point.  The failure 
to implement effective physical 
security measures. The failure to 
respond swiftly enough to the 
crisis on Utoya Island...

CUT TO:

248

INT. MOD - MEETING ROOM/CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

248

The PM walks towards a closed door. Hesitates before opening 
it.

Inside, he sees: BEREAVED PARENTS. Their LAWYERS too.

The PM sits amongst them. 

PRIME MINISTER

(finally)

I’m sorry. 

His voice breaks. 

PRIME MINISTER (CONT’D)

We should have done better. I 
should have done better.  

For a moment there is silence. Then a MOTHER reaches across 
the table.

MOTHER

(takes his hand)

I can only speak for myself.

(She looks around. Clearly 
she speaks for many 
there)

(MORE)

MOTHER (CONT'D)

Only the terrorist was responsible 
for what happened on that day. Not 
you. Only him. 

The PM looks up, holds her hand tightly, stunned by her 
grace.

140.

249

INT. COURTROOM - Day 8 - VERDICT - DAY 

BREIVIK standing.

CUT TO:

249

JUDGE ARTNZEN

The court finds Anders Behring 
Breivik guilty of all charges. And 
we judge him accountable for his 
actions. Mr. Breivik is therefore 
sentenced to indefinite solitary 
confinement. For as long as he 
remains a threat to society.

LIPPESTAD looks across at his colleagues. INGA and SVEINN for 
the Prosecution. FAMILY LAWYER for the families. And at the 
JUDGE. 

Knows they all played their roles, to ensure the system 
prevailed.

He and BREIVIK meet for the last time.

LIPPESTAD

Will you appeal?

BREIVIK

No, there’s no need. You did a good 
job. The job I wanted.

141.

LIPPESTAD

There are some formalities. My 
office will send over the 
paperwork. 

BREIVIK

Of course. Do you think you will 
you visit me?

LIPPESTAD

I don’t think so, Anders.

BREIVIK hands back documents. 

Then holds out his hand. LIPPESTAD doesn’t take it.

BREIVIK

So I guess we’re done.

LIPPESTAD

Yes.

As he reaches the door:

BREIVIK

Geir, I’d do it all again if I 
could.

LIPPESTAD stops. Turns to face him.

LIPPESTAD

You didn’t win, Anders. You failed.

BREIVIK

(beat and then)

There will be others. To finish 
what I have started. Norway - 
Europe - it’s crumbling. It’s over.

LIPPESTAD

We will stop you.

BREIVIK

You can’t even see us.

LIPPESTAD

Well we see you now. And we will 
beat you. My children, our 
children... they will beat you. 

(beat)

Goodbye, Anders.
