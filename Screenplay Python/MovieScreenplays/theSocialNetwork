FROM THE BLACK WE HEAR--

MARK (V.O.)

Did you know there are more people with 
genius IQ’s living in China than there 
are people of any kind living in the 
United States?

That can’t possibly be true.

ERICA (V.O.)

It is.

MARK (V.O.)

What would account for that?   

ERICA (V.O.)

MARK (V.O.)

Well, first, an awful lot of people live 
in China. But here’s my question:

FADE IN:
INT. CAMPUS BAR - NIGHT
MARK ZUCKERBERG is a sweet looking 19 year old whose lack of 
any physically intimidating attributes masks a very 
complicated and dangerous anger. He has trouble making eye 
contact and sometimes it’s hard to tell if he’s talking to you 
or to himself.
ERICA, also 19, is Mark’s date. She has a girl-next-door face 
that makes her easy to fall for. At this point in the 
conversation she already knows that she’d rather not be there 
and her politeness is about to be tested.
The scene is stark and simple.

MARK

How do you distinguish yourself in a 
population of people who all got 1600 on 
their SAT’s?

I didn’t know they take SAT’s in China.

ERICA

MARK

They don’t. I wasn’t talking about China 
anymore, I was talking about me.

You got 1600?

ERICA

MARK

Yes. I could sing in an a Capella group, 
but I can’t sing.

2.

ERICA

Does that mean you actually got nothing 
wrong?

I can row crew or invent a 25 dollar PC.

MARK

Or you can get into a final club.

ERICA

Or I can get into a final club. 

MARK

ERICA

You know, from a woman’s perspective, 
sometimes not singing in an a Capella 
group is a good thing?

MARK

This is serious.
ERICA

On the other hand I do like guys who row 
crew.

MARK

(beat)

Well I can’t do that. 

I was kid--

ERICA

MARK

Yes, it means I got nothing wrong on the 
test.

Have you ever tried?

ERICA

I’m trying right now.

MARK

To row crew?

ERICA

MARK

To get into a final club. To row crew? 
No. Are you, like--whatever--delusional?

ERICA

Maybe, but sometimes you say two things 
at once and I’m not sure which one I’m 
supposed to be aiming at.

But you’ve seen guys who row crew, right?

MARK

3.

No.

ERICA

MARK

Okay, well they’re bigger than me. 
They’re world class athletes. And a 
second ago you said you like guys who row 
crew so I assumed you had met one.

ERICA

I guess I just meant I liked the idea of 
it. The way a girl likes cowboys.

MARK

(beat)

Okay.

Should we get something to eat?

ERICA

MARK

Would you like to talk about something 
else?

ERICA

No, it’s just since the beginning of the 
conversation about finals club I think I 
may have missed a birthday.
There are really more people in China with 
genius IQ’s than the entire population of--

(can’t get over it)

MARK

The Phoenix is the most diverse. The Fly 
Club, Roosevelt punched the Porc. 

Which one?

ERICA

MARK

The Porcellian, the Porc, it’s the best 
of the best.

ERICA
Which Roosevelt?

Theodore.

MARK

ERICA

Is it true that they send a bus around to 
pick up girls who want to party with the 
next Fed Chairman?

MARK

You can see why it’s so important to get 
in.

4.

ERICA

Okay, well, which is the easiest to get 
into?

MARK is visibly hit by that...

Why would you ask me that?

MARK

ERICA
I’m just asking.

MARK

None of them, that’s the point. My friend 
Eduardo made $300,000 betting oil futures 
one summer and Eduardo won’t come close 
to getting in. The ability to make money 
doesn’t impress anybody around here.

ERICA

Must be nice. He made $300,000 in a 
summer?

He likes meteorology.

MARK

You said it was oil futures.

ERICA

MARK

You can read the weather you can predict 
the price of heating oil. I think you 
asked me that because you think the final 
club that’s easiest to get into is the 
one where I’ll have the best chance.

ERICA

I asked--what?
MARK

You asked me which one was the easiest to 
get into because you think that that’s 
the one where I’ll have the best chance.

ERICA

The one that’s the easiest to get into 
would be the one where anybody has the 
best chance.

MARK

You didn’t ask me which one was the best 
one, you asked me which one was the 
easiest one.

ERICA

I was honestly just asking. Okay? I was 
just asking to ask. Mark, I’m not 
speaking in code.

5.

Erica--

MARK

ERICA

You’re obsessed with finals clubs. You 
have finals clubs OCD and you need to see 
someone about it who’ll prescribe you 
some sort of medication. You don’t care 
if the side effects may include 
blindness.

MARK

Final clubs. Not finals clubs and there’s 
a difference between being obsessed and 
being motivated.
ERICA

Yes there is.

MARK
Well you do--that was cryptic--so you do 
speak in code.

I didn’t mean to be cryptic.

ERICA

MARK

I’m saying I need to do something 
substantial in order to get the attention 
of the clubs.

Why?

ERICA

MARK

Because they’re exclusive. And fun and 
they lead to a better life.

ERICA

Teddy Roosevelt didn’t get elected 
president because he was a member of the 
Phoenix Club.

MARK

He was a member of the Porcellian and yes 
he did.

ERICA

Well why don’t you just concentrate on 
being the best you you can be?

Did you really just say that?

MARK

ERICA
I was kidding.

ERICA (CONT'D)

Although just because something’s trite 
it doesn’t make it any less--

MARK

I want to try to be straight forward with 
you and tell you that I think you might 
want to be a little more supportive. If I 
get in I’ll be taking you...to the 
events, and the gatherings...and you’ll 
be meeting a lot of people you wouldn’t 
normally get to meet.

ERICA

(smiles)

You would do that for me?

We’re dating.

MARK

ERICA

Okay, well I want to try and be straight 
forward with you and let you know that 
we’re not anymore.

What do you mean?

MARK

We’re not dating anymore, I’m sorry.

ERICA

MARK
Is this a joke?
ERICA

No, it’s not.

You’re breaking up with me?

MARK

ERICA

You’re going to introduce me to people I 
wouldn’t normally have the chance to 
meet? What the fff--What is that supposed 
to mean?

Wait, settle down.

MARK

What is it supposed to mean?

ERICA

MARK

Erica, the reason we’re able to sit here 
and drink right now is cause you used to 
sleep with the door guy.

7.

ERICA

The door guy, his name is Bobby. I did 
not slept with the door guy, the door guy 
is a friend of mine. He’s a perfectly 
good class of people and what part of 
Long Island are you from--Wimbledon? 

Wait--

MARK

I’m going back to my dorm.

ERICA

Wait, wait, is this real?

MARK

Yes.

ERICA

Okay, then wait. I apologize, okay?

MARK

I have to go study.

ERICA

Erica--

Yeah.

MARK

ERICA

I’m sorry, I mean it.

MARK

I appreciate that but--

ERICA

Come on.

MARK

--I have to study.

ERICA

MARK

You don’t have to study. You don’t have 
to study. Let’s just talk.

I can’t.

Why?

ERICA

MARK

ERICA

Because it’s exhausting. Dating you is 
like dating a stairmaster.

8.

MARK

All I meant is that you’re not likely to--
currently--I wasn’t making a comment on 
your parents--I was just saying you go to 
B.U., I was stating a fact, that’s all, 
and if it seemed rude then of course I 
apologize.

I have to go study.

ERICA

You don’t have to study.

MARK

ERICA

Why do you keep saying I don’t have to 
study?!

Because you go to B.U.!

MARK

ERICA stares at him...

MARK (CONT’D)

(pause)

Do you want to get some food?

ERICA

I’m sorry you’re not sufficiently 
impressed with my education.

MARK

And I’m sorry I don’t have a rowboat so 
we’re even.

I think we should just be friends.

ERICA

I don’t want friends.

MARK

ERICA

I was being polite, I have no intention 
of being friends with you.

MARK

I’m under some pressure right now with my 
OS class and if we could just order food 
I think we should--

ERICA takes MARK’s hand and looks at him tenderly...

ERICA

(close)

You are probably going to be a very 
successful computer person. 

(MORE)

ERICA (CONT'D)

But you’re going to go through life 
thinking that girls don’t like you 
because you’re a nerd. And I want you to 
know, from the bottom of my heart, that 
that won’t be true. It’ll be because 
you’re an asshole.

of that up.

GRETCHEN
She was under oath.

MARK

Then I guess that would be the first time 
somebody’s lied under oath.

People are stretching and getting coffee and talking quietly. 
MARK stays in his seat.
MARYLIN, the attractive second year associate who’s on Mark’s 
legal team is still sitting too...about four seats down from 
Mark.

MARYLIN
The site got twenty-two hundred hits

What?

MARYLIN

Twenty-two thousand.

Wow.

EXT. CHARLES RIVER - DAWN
The Harvard Crew is practicing on two-man sculls. There are 
three boats that are running roughly even with each other and 
the two-man crews are rowing with all they’ve got. We’re 
gliding along with them in the water--

Those guys are just freakin’ fast.

A CREW MEMBER

And we PULL BACK TO REVEAL that there’s a fourth boat which is 
already five boat lengths ahead of the other three.
The fourth boat is being crewed by CAMERON and TYLER 
WINKLEVOSS--identical twins who stepped out of an ad for 
Abercrombie & Fitch.
They know that the others aren’t in their class and even 
though they’re highly competitive athletes, they don’t like 
showing anyone up, least of all their teammates.

CAMERON

Is there anyway to make this a fair 
fight?

We could jump out and swim.

TYLER

I think we’d have to jump out and drown.

CAMERON

TYLER

Or you could row forward and I could row 
backward.

CAMERON

We’re genetically identical, science says 
we’d stay in one place.

Row the damn boat.

The room’s a couple of hundred years old and magnificent. 
Long, heavy mahogany tables are dotted with club members 
having breakfast. A PORTER in a white jacket is setting copies 
of The Crimson, Harvard’s student newspaper, at the table 
occupied by CAMERON and TYLER whose trays are loaded with 
mountains of eggs and pancakes and carbs.
DIVYA NARENDRA, a nice looking Indian student, sits down next 
to them holding a copy of the Crimson.

What’s up?

CAMERON

You guys hear about this?

DIVYA

What?

CAMERON

DIVYA

Two nights ago a sophomore choked the 
network from a laptop at Kirkland.

Really?

At 4AM.

CAMERON

DIVYA

TYLER picks up a copy of the Crimson and begins reading while 
his brother and DIVYA keep talking.

How?

CAMERON

DIVYA

He set up a website where you vote on the 
hotness of female undergrads. What were 
we doing that none of us heard about 
this?

CAMERON

I don’t know, a three hour low-rate 
technical row before breakfast, a full 
course load, studying, another three 
hours in the tank and then studying. I 
don’t know how we missed it. How much 
activity was there on this thing that he--

TYLER

22,000 page requests.

22,000?!

CAMERON

TYLER

Cam, this guy hacked the into facebooks

he was drunk.

22,000.

Yeah.

MARK stands before a panel of ADMINISTRATORS as well as COX, 
the systems manager who was woken up in the opening sequence.

ADMINISTRATOR

Mr. Zuckerberg, this is an Administrative 
Board hearing. You’re being accused of 
intentionally breaching security, 
violating copyrights, violating 
individual privacy by creating the 
website, WWW.FACEMASH.COM. You’re also 
charged with being in violation of 
university policy on distribution of 
digitized images. Before we begin with 
our questioning you’re allowed to make a 
statement. Would you like to do so?

MARK

(beat)

Uh...I’ve, you know--

MARK stands to address the Board.
MARK (CONT’D)

I’ve already apologized in the Crimson to 
the ABHW, to Fuerza Latina and to any 
women at Harvard who might have been 
insulted as I take it that they were. As 
for any charges stemming from the breach 
of security, I believe I deserve some 
recognition from this Board.

MARK takes his seat.

ADMINISTRATOR

(pause)

I’m sorry?

Yes.

MARK

I don’t understand.

ADMINISTRATOR

Which part?

MARK

ADMINISTRATOR
You deserve recognition?

MARK

I believe I pointed out some pretty 
gaping holes in your system.

Excuse me, may I?

COX

28.

Yes.

ADMINISTRATOR

COX

Mr. Zuckerberg, I’m in charge of security 
for all computers on the Harvard network 
and I can assure you of its 
sophistication. In fact it was that level 
of sophistication that led us to you in 
less than four hours.

Four hours?

MARK

Yes sir.

COX

That would be impressive except if you’d 
known what you were looking for you would 
have seen it written on my dorm room 
window.

INT. LECTURE HALL - DAY
MARK is in his Operating Systems class. This is considered the 
hardest class at Harvard and MARK is one of the 50 students 
with their laptops open as the professor takes them through an 
impossibly difficult lesson.

PROFESSOR

Okay, let’s look at a sample problem: 
Suppose we’re given a computer with a 16-
bit virtual address and a page size of 
256 bytes.

A GIRL scribbles something on a piece of paper. Then hands it 
to the student next to her and nods that it should be passed 
over to MARK. While that’s happening--
PROFESSOR (CONT’D)

The system uses one-level page tables, 
that start at address 0x0400. Maybe you 
want to have DMA on your 16-bit system, 
who knows? The first few pages are 
reserved for hardware flags, etc.

MARK opens the note. It reads “U dick”. 
He looks over and sees a couple of GIRLS looking at him with 
contempt.

PROFESSOR (CONT’D)

Assume page table entries have eight 
status bits.

MARK closes his laptop, gets up and starts to head out of the 
hall.

The eight status bits would be--
And I see we have our first surrender.

than you have tried and failed at this 
class.

No, you didn’t insult our girl--
Actually, I don’t know.

We never asked.

CAMERON

We should do that. No, we have an idea we

TYLER

DIVYA

You go online and see what courses your 
friends are taking.
Really smart, man.

We were talking about CourseMatch. 

DIVYA

It was kind of a no-brainer.

MARK opens it on his lap and eats it uncomfortably.

school, right?
MARK

An app for an MP3 player that recognizes 
your taste in music.

Anybody try to buy it?

I didn’t sell it. I uploaded it for free.

MARK

For free?

Yeah.

Why?

DIVYA

MARK gives a short shrug that says both “I don’t know” and 
“Fuck you” at the same time.
CAMERON

Okay, well. We have something that we’ve  
been working on for a while, we think 
it’s great. It’s called the 
HarvardConnection. You create your own 
page. Interests, bio, friends, pics.

TYLER

And then people can go online, see your 
bio and request to be your--

MARK

Yeah. How’s it different from MySpace or 
Friendster?

TYLER

Harvard-dot-E-D-U.
CAMERON

Harvard.edu. The most prestigious e-mail 
address in the country.

TYLER

And the whole site’s kinda based on the 
idea that girls--well...

Not to put anything indelicately.

CAMERON

DIVYA

Girls wanna get with guys who go to 
Harvard.

CAMERON

Divya and my brother don’t have trouble 
putting things indelicately.

TYLER

The difference between what we’re talking 
about and MySpace or Friendster or any of 
those other social networking site--

--is exclusivity.
Right?

DIVYA

TYLER

Right.

Yes.

CAMERON

We’d love fort you to work with us, Mark. 
I mean, we need a gifted programmer who’s

Night.

INT. LARGE MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM - NIGHT
The hall has been converted into “Alpha Epsilon Pi Caribbean 
Night, 2003” and the party is about as lame as it sounds. 
What’s important is that this couldn’t be less like the final 
club party we saw at the beginning if they were playing Pin 
the Tail on the Donkey.
Some potted palm trees have been brought in along with a steel 
drum set. The man playing the steel drum set has a yarmulke 
bobby pinned to his thinning hair. A table with a punch bowl 
and assorted cookies is nearby.
EDUARDO, in baggy cargo shorts and a Hawaiian shirt buttoned 
up to the top, is standing with a few similarly dressed 
friends, including DUSTIN MOSKOVITZ and CHRIS HUGHES, in the 
sparsely populated room. On the other side of the room are a 
few girls--all Asian. One of the girls is wearing a bikini 
over her clothes. A television monitor has been set up with a 
DVD running of Niagara Falls.

EDUARDO

It’s not that guys like me are generally 
attracted to Asian girls. It’s that Asian 
girls are generally attracted to guys 
like me.

DUSTIN

I’m developing an algorithm to define the 
connection between Jewish guys and Asian 
girls.

EDUARDO

I don’t think it’s that complicated. 
They’re hot, they’re smart, they’re not 
Jewish and they can’t dance.

Mark’s here.

CHRIS

They see MARK come in and look around. EDUARDO waves him 
over...

MARK sees EDUARDO and waves him over to where he is. He wants 
to talk privately.

ice.

Hang on, I’ve gotta tell you something 
you’re not going to believe.

I got punched by the Phoenix.

EDUARDO

MARK

Are you kidding?

EDUARDO

No. I mean it’s just the first of the 
four step process but they slipped the 
invitation under my door tonight. I go to 
the first punch party tomorrow and if 
they like me--
MARK

You got punched by the Phoenix.

EDUARDO

(pause)

It was, you know...it was probably just a 
diversity thing. It was just a diversity 
thing. I’ll just ride that horse until--
what did you want to talk to me about?
Mark?

Yeah.

MARK

You said you’ve come up with something.

It seems like MARK’s just made a small decision in his head.

MARK

People came to Facemash in a stampede, 
right?

Yeah.

EDUARDO

MARK

It wasn’t because they saw pictures of 
hot girls. You can go anywhere on the 
internet and see pictures of hot girls.

Yeah.

EDUARDO

MARK

It was because they saw pictures of girls 
that they knew. People want to go on the 
internet and check out their friends. Why 
not build a website that offers that? 
Friends, pictures, profiles, whatever you 
can...visit, browse around, maybe it’s 
somebody you just met at a party. I’m not 
talking about a dating site. I’m talking 
about taking the entire social experience 
of college and putting it online. 

I can’t feel my legs.

too. But Wardo--

EDUARDO

MARK

Wardo, it’s like a Final Club except 
we’re the president.

CUT TO:
INT. FIRST DEPOSITION ROOM - DAY

EDUARDO

I told him I thought it sounded great. It 
was a great idea. There was nothing to 
hack, people were going to provide their 
own pictures, their own information. And 
people had the ability to invite--or not
invite--their friends to join. See, in a 
world where social structure was 
everything, that was the thing.
It was a big project and he was going to 
have to write tens of thousands of lines 
of code so I wondered why he was coming 
to me and not his roommates. Dustin 
Moskovitz and Chris Hughes they were 
programmers.

What are you suggesting?

They’re suggesting I was jealous of 
Eduardo for getting punched by the 
Phoenix and began a plan to screw him out 
of a company I hadn’t even invented yet.

We recognize that you’re a plaintiff in 
one suit involving Facebook and a witness

Yes sir.

EDUARDO

GAGE

At any time in the weeks prior to Mark’s 
telling you his idea, did he mention 
Tyler Winklevoss, Cameron Winklevoss, 
Divya Narendra or HarvardConnection?

43.

EDUARDO

Yes. He said they’d asked him to work on 
their site but that he’d looked at what 
they had and decided it wasn’t worth his 
time. He said even his most pathetic 
friends knew more about getting people 
interested in a website than these guys. 

“These guys” meaning my clients.

GAGE

EDUARDO

Yes. He resented--Mark resented that they--
your clients, thought he needed to 
rehabilitate his image after Facemash but 
Mark didn’t want to rehabilitate anything. 
With Facemash he’d hacked into the Harvard 
computers, he’d thumbed his nose at the Ad 
Board, he’d gotten a lot of notoriety. 
Facemash did exactly what he wanted it to 
do.

MARK kind of nods a little to himself. 
It should be noted that these depositions have an extra 
element of discomfort as everything is being said within a few 
feet of the people being talked about.

GAGE

Were you aware that while Mr. Zuckerberg
was building TheFacebook he was also 
communicating with the plaintiffs?

EDUARDO

Not at the time I wasn’t, but it really 
didn’t have much to do with the 
Winklevoss’s dating-- 

You weren’t there!

TYLER

Were you aware that while Mr. Zuckerberg

MARK is working at a station. We can see through the windows

in his hoodie and cargo shorts nonetheless. It looks like he 
hasn’t slept in days. On his monitor we can see that he’s 
working on the profile page for theFacebook.
DUSTIN MOSKOVITZ steps up to him quietly.

INT. KIRKLAND HOUSE/LOBBY - MORNING
The heavy door bursts open and MARK comes busting through. He 
makes his way with speed and intent up a flight of stairs.
Then another.
And then another until he gets to his floor. He sprints down 
his hall toward his dorm room and barely notices EDUARDO 
leaning against the door.

We were supposed to meet at 9.

EDUARDO

MARK is searching the pockets of his shorts for his keys.

Have you slept yet?

EDUARDO (CONT’D)

MARK opens the door and they go into his suite--

familiar--A photo, sex, a profile, a list of attributes, a 
poke application, etc.

But watch.

MARK (CONT’D)

MARK’s called up a the Emacs program and quickly writes out 
several lines of code...

EDUARDO

MARK goes back to the profile page. There’s a new area to be 
filled in...

MARK

“Relationship Status”, “Interested In”.
This is what drives life at college. Are 
you having sex or aren’t you. It’s why 
people take certain classes, and sit 
where they sit, and do what they do, and 
at its, um, center, you know, that’s what

THE KROKODILOES, Harvard’s oldest male a Capella group, are 
singing at the front of the hall in their usual uniform of 
white tie and tails for a packed crowd of students and 
parents.
Incongruously, but with surprisingly nice results, the group 
is covering a song from All-4-One--”I Swear”--and the pub full 
of students is loving it.
We find a table in the back where DIVYA is sitting with his 
girlfriend and some of their friends who are having a nice 
time. Divya’s girlfriend, K.C., has her laptop open.

MALE FRIEND

What ever happened to Cole Porter and 
Irving Berlin?

FEMALE FRIEND

It’s a Valentine’s theme. They’re playing 
love songs.

MALE FRIEND

Good point, ‘cause Cole Porter and Irving 
Berlin never wrote any love songs.

DIVYA starts to bolt out of the pub. His foot gets caught on a 
chair leg and he falls hard face-first to the floor.

It’s fine.

starts out and falls down all over again.

That’s right.

DIVYA

talking a lot about a universal facebook 
within Harvard’, he says”--he meaning 
Mark--”’I think it’s kind of silly that 
it would take the University a couple of 
years to get around to it. I can do a 
classier job than they can and I did in a 
week.’”

Tell him Divya Narendra called, I 
appreciate it.

I know, that’s how he talks.

Crimson)

“As of yesterday evening, Zuckerberg said 
over 650 students had registered to use 
theFacebook.com. He said he anticipated 
that 900 students would have joined the 
site by this morning.”

Yeah, Divya was just reading that 650 
students signed up for it on the first 
day.

TYLER

If I were a drug dealer I couldn’t give

half while he--

He never lied to our faces.

CAMERON

TYLER)

He never saw our faces! He lied to our e-
mail accounts and he got himself a 42-day 
head start because he knows what 
apparently you don’t which is that 
getting there first is everything!

CAMERON

I’m a competitive racer, Div, I don’t 
think you need to school me on the 
importance of getting there first, thank 
you.

Alright. That was your father’s lawyer?

DIVYA

CAMERON

It was his in-house counsel, he’ll look 
at it and if he thinks it’s appropriate 
he’ll send a cease and desist letter.

What’s that gonna do?

DIVYA

CAMERON

What, do you wanna hire and IP lawyer and 
sue him?

DIVYA

No, I wanna hire the Sopranos to beat the 
shit out of him with a hammer.

We don’t even have to do that.

TYLER

That’s right.

CAMERON

We can do that ourselves.

TYLER

Hey--

CAMERON

I’m six-five, 220 and there’s two of me.

TYLER

I’m with this guy.

DIVYA

CAMERON

And I’m saying let’s calm down until we 
know what we’re talking about.

DIVYA

How much more information are you waiting 
for? We met with Mark three times, we 
exchanged 52 e-mails, we can prove that 
he looked at the code-- 
What is that on the bottom of the page?

CAMERON

(he’s already seen it)

It says “A Mark Zuckerberg Production”.

On the home page?

DIVYA

On every page.

TYLER

Shit, I need a second to let the 
classiness waft over me.

Look--

CAMERON

TYLER

Cam. They wrote, “Zuckerberg said that he 
hoped the privacy options would help to 
restore his reputation following student 
outrage over Facemash.com”.
That’s exactly what WE said to him. He’s 
giving us the finger in the Crimson. Now

There’s a lower-level and a balcony and both are full.
MARK and EDUARDO are sitting in the second to last row of the

It was a beautiful day and I was in my

magazine and he said, “Look, it’s going

right. Let’s get BASIC out there.”

He gets an appreciative LAUGH from the STUDENTS.

--had an 8080 microprocessor in it, 
unless you paid extra for a 1K memory 
board, you had 256 bytes.

EDUARDO hears the giggling again and turns around.
In the row behind them and a few seats over are two beautiful 
Asian students--ALICE and CHRISTY. They’re a little overly 
made-up for a lecture. CHRISTY, the one sitting closest to 
EDUARDO, is wearing a short skirt with a white shirt open one 
button too far down the front and we can see a hint of the red 
bra she’s wearing underneath.
She leans forward and whispers to EDUARDO--

CHRISTY

Your friend--is that Mark Zuckerberg?

EDUARDO

Uh...yes.

He made theFacebook.

EDUARDO smiles a little...this has just never happened--

EDUARDO

Yeah. I mean it’s both of ours--but, yeah

Cool. I’m Christy. This is Alice.

EDUARDO can’t help noticing--just because it’s in his line of

pointing at them and whispering to a friend.
Then back to the girls--

EDUARDO

Very nice to meet you.

CHRISTY

don’t know what it is, we don’t know what 
it can be, we don’t know what it will be. 
We know that it’s cool, that is a 
priceless asset I’m not giving it up.

When will it be finished?

EDUARDO

MARK

It won’t be finished, that’s the point. 
The way fashion’s never finished.

What?

EDUARDO

70.

Fashion. Fashion is never finished.

MARK

EDUARDO

You’re talking about fashion? Really? 
You?

MARK

I’m talking about the idea of it and I’m 
saying it’s never finished.

EDUARDO

Okay, but they manage to make money 
selling pants...

EDUARDO has seen something on the top of MARK’s mantle...

Mark, what is this?

EDUARDO (CONT’D)

What.

MARK

EDUARDO holds up a letter that’s on a lawyer’s stationary.

This.

EDUARDO

MARK

It’s called a cease and desist letter. 
What were their names? 

Who?

EDUARDO

The girls.

MARK

EDUARDO’s speed reading the letter.

When did you get this?

EDUARDO

MARK

About 10 days ago. Right after we 
launched the site.
EDUARDO

Jesus Christ.

Hey, the girls. What were their names?

MARK

EDUARDO

They’re saying--the Winklevoss twins are 
saying you stole their idea.

71.

MARK

I find that to be a little more than 
mildly annoying.

EDUARDO

They find it to be intellectual property 
theft. Why--

Look--

MARK

--why didn’t you show this to me?

EDUARDO

It was addressed to me.

MARK

EDUARDO

They’re saying we stole theFacebook from 
Divya Narendra and the Wink--

I know what it says.

MARK

EDUARDO

(pause)

Did we?

Did we what?

MARK

EDUARDO

Don’t screw around with me now. Look at 
me.

MARK looks at EDUARDO--

EDUARDO (CONT’D)

The letter says we could face legal 
action.

No, it says I could face legal action.

MARK

EDUARDO

It’s from a lawyer, Mark. They must feel 
they have some grounds for--

MARK

The lawyer is their father’s house 
counsel.

Do they have grounds?

EDUARDO

72.

MARK

The grounds are our thing is cool and 
popular and HarvardConnection is lame. 
Wardo, I didn’t use any of their code, I 
promise I didn’t use anything. A guy who 
builds a really nice chair doesn’t owe 
money to everyone who has ever built a 
chair. They came to me with an idea, I 
had a better one.
EDUARDO

Why didn’t you show me the letter?

I didn’t think it was a big deal.

MARK

EDUARDO

If there’s something wrong--if there’s 
ever anything wrong--you can tell me. I’m 
the guy that wants to help. This is our
thing.
Is there anything you need to tell me?

(pause)

No.

MARK

What are we doing about this?

EDUARDO

MARK

I went to a 3-L at Student Legal Services 
and he told me to write them back.

EDUARDO
What did you say?

I’d raised concerns before.

Gentlemen.
I’m talking about at the meeting in 
January to which this letter is 
referring.

Yeah.

MARK

GAGE

Let me re-phrase this. You sent my 
clients 16 e-mails. In the first 15, you 
didn’t raise any concerns.

MARK

(beat)

Is that a question?

GAGE

In the 16th e-mail you raised concerns 
about the site’s functionality. Were you 
leading them on for six weeks?

No.

MARK

GAGE

Why hadn’t you raised any of these 
concerns before?

MARK

(quietly)
It’s raining.

I’m sorry?

GAGE

It just started raining.

MARK

GAGE

Mr. Zuckerberg, do I have your full 
attention?

No.

MARK

GAGE

(beat)

Do you think I deserve it?

What.

MARK

GAGE

Do you think I deserve your full 
attention?

MARK

I had to swear an oath before we began 
this deposition and I don’t want to 
perjure myself so I have a legal 
obligation to say no.

GAGE

Okay. “No” you don’t think I deserve your 
attention.

MARK

I think if your clients want to sit on my 
shoulders and call themselves tall they 
have a right to give it a try. But 
there’s no requirement that I enjoy 
sitting here listening to people lie. You 
have part of my attention--you have the 
minimum amount. The rest of my attention 
is back at the offices of Facebook where 
my colleagues and I are doing things that 
no one in this room, including and 
especially your clients, are 
intellectually or creatively capable of 
doing. Did I adequately answer your 
condescending question?

GAGE just looks casually at MARK. MARK doesn’t meet his gaze, 
or the looks from DIVYA, TYLER and CAMERON...

INT. MARK’S DORM ROOM - NIGHT

So, what were their names?

MARK

EDUARDO

(pause)

Their names were Christy and Alice. They 
want to have drinks tonight.

CUT TO:
INT. MEN’S ROOM - NIGHT
It’s a nice men’s room--mahogony stalls--in a nice club in 
Cambridge. We HEAR the thumping of the house music coming from 
the club.
And then one of the wooden stall doors flies open and EDUARDO 
is shoved in, followed by CHRISTY, who did the shoving. She’s 
all over him as she presses him back against the divider.
EDUARDO’s hands are sliding under CHRISTY’S white shirt and 
finding the red bra when they hear a noise.
Someone’s gone into the next stall.

EDUARDO

(whispering)

Shit.

CHRISTY

(whispering)

I don’t care.

CHRISTY keeps him pinned against the divider as she reaches 
down and unbuckles his belt.
And then he hears another noise from the stall next door. A 
thump against the divider. CHRISTY’s got his fly unzipped.
EDUARDO looks down at the space between the stalls. He sees a 
pair of Adidas flip-flops.

76.

Then the sound of moaning. Before EDUARDO has time to say 
anything, CHRISTY pulls her shirt open, revealing the red bra, 
and puts her hand down his pants as we
CUT TO:
INT. CLUB/MEN’S ROOM - NIGHT
MARK and EDUARDO are standing guard outside the door. They’re 
silent but very happy.
A guy comes along to use the men’s room.

EDUARDO

Sorry. It’ll just be a minute. Some girls 
are freshening up in there.

CLUB GUY

(nodding a little)

Sweet.
The guy goes off.
EDUARDO taps MARK...

EDUARDO
We have groupies.

(beat)

MARK can’t help a smile. Then he sees something...

I’ll be right back.

MARK

EDUARDO

Mark, where you going?
Mark?

(beat)

MARK makes his way through the crowd toward a round booth. A 
girl is sitting there and even though her back is to MARK he 
can recognize her. She’s with a girlfriend and three guys.
When he makes it to the booth he says--

Erica?

MARK

ERICA, from the opening scene, turns her head and looks up to 
see MARK. She’s looking sexy for her Friday night on the town 
and the three guys she’s with are studs. A few more friends of 
theirs are standing around at the edges of the booth. 

ERICA

(pause)

Hi.

77.

MARK

I saw you from over there. I didn’t know 
you came to this club a lot.

First time.

ERICA

MARK

Mine too. Could I talk to you alone for a 
second?

I think I’m good right here.

ERICA

MARK

I just--I’d love to talk to you alone. If 
we could just go someplace--

Right here’s fine.

ERICA

MARK is aware of everyone else around the booth...

MARK

(beat)

I don’t know if you heard about this new 
website I launched.

No.

ERICA

TheFacebook?

MARK

ERICA

You called me a bitch on the internet, 
Mark.

MARK

That’s why I wanted to talk to you. If we 
could just--

ERICA
On the internet.

That’s why I came over.

MARK

Comparing women to farm animals?

ERICA

I didn’t end up doing that.

MARK

78.

ERICA

It didn’t stop you from writing it. As if 
every thought that tumbles through your 
head is so clever it would be a crime for 
it not to be shared. The internet’s not 
written in pencil, Mark, it’s written in 
ink and you published that Erica Albright 
was a bitch right before you made some 
ignorant crack about my family’s name, my 
bra size and then rated women based on 
their “hotness”.

Erica, is there a problem?

REGGIE (A FRIEND OF ERICA’S)

ERICA

(pause)

No, there’s no problem.
You write your snide bullshit from a dark 
room because that’s what the angry do
nowadays. I was nice to you. Don’t 
torture me for it.

MARK glances at the table of Erica’s friends--

MARK

(pause)

If we could just go somewhere for a 
minute--

ERICA

No, I don’t want to be rude to my 
friends.

Okay.

MARK

Okay. Good luck with your video game.

ERICA

It was an honest mistake on ERICA’s part but a kidney punch to 
MARK.
MARK turns and goes and sees that EDUARDO has been standing 
and watching from a distance with CHRISTY.

EDUARDO

Hey, that was great. That was the right 
thing to do. You apologized, right?

MARK

(ignoring him)
We have to expand.
EDUARDO

(over the music)

What?

And MARK heads out the door.
EDUARDO watches MARK and then looks back at the girls...

Is he mad about something?

ALICE

INT. MARK’S DORM ROOM - NIGHT
The door closes behind DUSTIN MOSKOVITZ and CHRIS HUGHES. MARK 
and EDUARDO are waiting and CHRISTY and ALICE are sitting on 
the couch. Everyone’s got a beer.
Once the door is closed--
MARK

We’re expanding to Yale and Columbia. 
Dustin, I want you to share the coding 
work with me. Chris, you’re going to be 
in charge of publicity and outreach and 
you can start by getting a story in the 
B.U. student newspaper. The Bridge.

They hate doing stories about Harvard.

CHRIS

MARK

Somebody at the newspaper will be a 
computer science major. Tell ‘em Mark 
Zuckerberg will do 10 hours of free 
programming.

Why do you want a story in the B.U. newsp--

EDUARDO

MARK

Because I do. Here’s the arrangement. 
Eduardo is CFO and owns 30% of the 
company. Dustin is Vice President and 
Head of Programming and his 5% of the 
company will come from my end. Chris is 
Director of Publicity and his 
compensation will depend on the amount of 
work he ends up doing. Any questions?

DUSTIN

Who are the girls?
EDUARDO
Christy and Alice.

Hi.

DUSTIN

Hi.

Hello.

Hi.

CHRISTY

ALICE

CHRIS

Is there anything we can do?

CHRISTY

MARK

No. That’s it. Yale and Columbia, let’s

EDUARDO

What?

MARK

EDUARDO

Stanford. It’s time for them to see this 
in Palo Alto.

INT. FIRST DEPOSITION ROOM - DAY
MARK is sitting alone in the now empty room. There’s a 
computer on a table in the corner and MARK makes a few 
keystrokes and then reads the screen.
MARYLIN, the young lawyer we met early on, comes in with a 
plastic salad container in her hand and sits at the far end of 
the table from MARK, who doesn’t acknowledge her.

MARYLIN

(after a moment)

You don’t want any lunch?

MARK

No.

You’re welcome to some salad.

MARYLIN

No thank you.

MARK

MARYLIN
This must be hard.

Who are you?

I’m Marylin Delpy, I introduced myself--

MARYLIN

I mean what do you do?

MARK

MARYLIN

I’m a second year associate at the firm. 
My boss wanted me to sit in on the 
deposition phase.

MARK nods...

What are you doing?

MARYLIN (CONT’D)

MARK

Checking in to see how it’s going in 
Bosnia. 

Bosnia?

MARYLIN

MARK nods...

MARYLIN (CONT’D)

They don’t have roads but they have 
Facebook?

MARK nods...

You must really hate the Winklevoss’s.

MARYLIN (CONT’D)

MARK

(pause)

I don’t hate anybody.
The Winklevi aren’t suing me for 
intellectual property theft. They’re 
suing me because for the first time in 
their lives, things didn’t work out the 
way they were supposed to for them.

TYLER and CAMERON are both studying when DIVYA busts in.

DIVYA
He’s expanding.

He’s expanding to Yale, Columbia and 
Stanford, it’ll be in the Crimson
tomorrow.

Really.

Yeah.

TYLER

DIVYA

TYLER

So that Cease and Desist letter really 
scared the shit out of him, huh?

DIVYA

I want to hire a lawyer to file for 
injunctive relief and get this website
taken down now!

Look--

CAMERON

DIVYA

Every minute the site is up, Harvard 
Connection becomes less valuable. I want 
an injunction, I want damages, I want 
punitive relief and I want him dead.

I want those things too!

CAMERON

DIVYA

Then why aren’t we doing anything about 
it?! Because we’re gentlemen of Harvard?!

CAMERON

Because you’re not thinking about how 
it’ll look.

DIVYA
How’ll it look?

CAMERON

Like my brother and I are in skeleton 
costumes chasing the Karate Kid around a 
high school gym.
DIVYA

He’s violated Massachusetts state law. 
When he goes to Connecticut, New York and 
California he’ll have violated federal 
law. And by the way, he’s in violation of 
Harvard law.

There’s no such thing as Harvard Law.

CAMERON

83.

TYLER

(pause--realizing)

Wait. Yes there is.

TYLER goes to the bookshelf and pulls down a manual.

TYLER (CONT’D)

Harvard Student Handbook. Every freshman 
is issued one of these. Somewhere in this 
book it says--

CAMERON

(eureka)

--you can’t steal from another student. 
This is what we needed. We’re going to 
Summers.

DIVYA

You can’t get a meeting with Larry 
Summers.

CAMERON

My brother and I pay tuition at this 
school, we carry a 3.9 GPA at this 
school, we’ve won trophies for this 
school and we’ll be rowing in the 
Olympics for this school. I want a

school.
Why Stanford?

INT. A GIRL’S COLLEGE APARTMENT (PALO ALTO) - MORNING
A pretty 20 year-old co-ed, AMY, pulls a curtain open and the 
darkened room immediately fills with un-welcomed sunlight. 
AMY’s wearing nothing but a Stanford sweatshirt as a skinny 22 
year-old guy who’s lying on her futon wakes up. There’s other 
evidence on the walls that we’re at Stanford University. There 
are also pieces of AMY’s clothing strewn about.
The young man on the futon is SEAN PARKER.

I’m sorry, I’m late for Bio-Chem.

AMY

Okay.

SEAN

You don’t know my name, do you?

AMY

84.

SEAN
Is it Stanford?

(off the sweatshirt)

AMY

I should just kick your ass. How can you 
go to a party, meet--

SEAN

Amelia Ritter but you prefer Amy. You’re 
from Orinda, your father’s in commercial 
real estate and your mother’s 10 years 
sober.

AMY

What’s my major?

Trombone.

Really?

SEAN

AMY

I remember something about a trombone.

SEAN

AMY
Tu fais l'amour à la jolie fille et la 
mets de côté.

French! Your major is French.

SEAN

AMY

Oui. And yours?
SEAN

Mine? I don’t have one.

You haven’t declared?

AMY

I don’t go to school.

SEAN

AMY

You’re kidding?
SEAN

No.

Where did you go to school?

AMY

85.

SEAN

William Taft Elementary for a little 
while.

AMY

Seriously, you’re not like 15 years old 
or anything are you?

SEAN

No.
You’re not like--

No. So what do you do?

AMY

I’m an entrepreneur.

SEAN

You’re unemployed.

AMY

I wouldn’t say that.

SEAN

What would you say?

AMY

That I’m an entrepreneur.

SEAN

What was your latest preneur?

AMY

SEAN

Well...I founded an internet company that 
let folks download and share music for 
free.

Kind of like Napster?

AMY

Exactly like Napster.

SEAN

What do you mean?

AMY

I founded Napster.

SEAN

Sean Parker founded Napster.

AMY

You just slept on Sean Parker.

SEAN

You’re a zillionaire.

AMY

Not technically.

SEAN

AMY
What are you?

SEAN

Broke. There’s not a lot of money in free 
music. Even less when you’re being sued 
by everyone who’s ever been to the 
Grammys.

This is blowing my mind.

AMY

I appreciate that.

SEAN

AMY

I have to hop in the shower and get ready 
for class. 

SEAN

Bio-chem, even though you’re a French 
major whose name is Amy.

You passed.

AMY

I’m a hard worker.

SEAN

AMY

There’s juice or anything else you can 
find. Help yourself.

You mind if I check my e-mail?

SEAN

Go ahead.

AMY

AMY heads into the bathroom but leaves the door a little ajar.
SEAN steps over to AMY’s pink laptop and hits a key to wake it 
out of sleep mode.
The shower starts running in the bathroom.
The laptop springs to life and is open to something SEAN’s 
never seen before--a Facebook page.
He sees AMY’s picture and a short profile: Her major at 
Stanford, courses she’s taking, books she likes, clubs she’s a 
member of...

SEAN

(calling)

Amy?

She can’t hear him in the shower. 
SEAN explores around a little more. He knows his way around a 
computer. He sees her “friends”. Friend after friend after 
friend. 

SEAN (CONT’D)

(almost a whisper)

Jesus.

He gets up and goes to the bathroom door--

Amy?

SEAN (CONT’D)

AMY

(calling back)

Yeah!

Can you come out here?

SEAN

AMY
(calling)
Just a second!

SEAN tries to wait but can’t--

There’s a snake in here, Amy.

SEAN

What?!

AMY

AMY grabs a towel and jumps out of the shower--

Where?!

AMY (CONT’D)

SEAN
There isn’t a snake, but I need to ask 
you something.
AMY

Are you kidding me?! I could have been 
killed!

SEAN

How?

AMY

(beat--not sure)

By running too fast...and getting twisted 
in the curtain--What do you need to ask 
me?

SEAN

I went to check my e-mail and there’s a 
site open on your computer.

AMY

After you passed out last night I went on 
theFacebook for a little bit.

What’s that?

SEAN

AMY

TheFacebook? Stanford’s had it for like 
two weeks now it’s really awesome except 
it’s freakishly addictive. Seriously, I’m 
on the thing like five times a day.

SEAN

Everything’s great. I just need to find 
you, Mark Zuckerberg.

CAMERON and TYLER, in dark suits, are waiting to see the 
president of Harvard.

The President’s office is in one of the two oldest university

CAMERON

I’ve never been in this building before.

INT. SUMMERS’ OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
LARRY SUMMERS, a large man, is on the phone at his desk in his 
well-appointed office. A fire crackles in the sitting area and 
a 40-ish African-American woman, ANNE, in a pants suit is 
nearby going over some papers.
SUMMERS waves the boys in--
SUMMERS

(into phone)
That’s just their own stupidity, I should 
have been there.
(into phone)
Darkness is the absence of light and 
stupidity in that instance was the 
absence of me.

SUMMERS motions for them to sit and they do. They take in some 
of the photographs around the room--SUMMERS with BILL CLINTON, 
etc.

SUMMERS (CONT’D)

Catherine, I have students in my office 
now.

SUMMERS (CONT’D)

Alright.

SUMMERS hangs up the phone--

Good morning.

SUMMERS (CONT’D)

CAMERON

Good morning, sir. I’m Cameron Winklevoss 
and this is my brother, Tyler.

SUMMERS reaches to the top of a pile of papers and pulls a ten-
page letter off the top. 

And you’re here because...

SUMMERS

There’s silence while SUMMERS appears to read over the 
letter...

Either one of you can answer.

SUMMERS (CONT’D)

CAMERON

I’m sorry, I thought you were reading the 
letter.

I’ve read the letter.

SUMMERS

CAMERON

We came up with an idea for a website
called HarvardConnection--we’ve since 
changed the name to ConnectU--and Mark 
Zuckerberg stole that idea and--

SUMMERS
I understand. I’m asking what do you want 
me to do about it.

CAMERON points to a row of Harvard Student Handbooks on the 
bookshelf behind SUMMERS.

CAMERON

Well sir, in The Harvard Student 
Handbook, which is distributed to each 
freshman--under the heading “Standards of 
Conduct in the Harvard Community”--

91.

SUMMERS can’t help an agonized sigh--
CAMERON (CONT’D)

--it says, “The College expects that all 
students will be honest and forthcoming 
in their dealings with members of this 
community. All students are required to 
respect public and private ownership. 
Instances of theft, misappropriation--

Anne?

Yes sir.

SUMMERS

ANNE

SUMMERS

Punch me in the face.
(then to CAMERON)
Go ahead.

CAMERON

(beat)

...or unauthorized use will result in 
disciplinary action. Including 
requirement to withdraw from the college.

SUMMERS

And you memorized that instead of doing 
what?

CAMERON

What my brother and I came here today to 
ask of you, respectfully of course, is 
that--

TYLER

(a little frustrated with this 
bullshit)

Sir, it’s against University rules to 
steal from another student, plain and 
simple.

You’ve spoken to your House Master?

SUMMERS

CAMERON

Yes sir, and the House Master made a 
recommendation to the Ad Board but the Ad 
Board won’t see us.

SUMMERS
Have you tried dealing with the other 
student directly?

92.

CAMERON

Mr. Zuckerberg hasn’t been responding to 
any of our e-mails or phone calls for the 
last two weeks. He doesn’t answer when we 
knock on his door at Kirkland and the 
closest we’ve come to dealing with him 
face to face is when I saw him on the 
quad and chased him through Harvard 
Square. 

You chased him?

SUMMERS

CAMERON

(beat)

I saw him and I know he saw me and I went 
after him but he disappeared. 

I don’t see this as a University issue.

SUMMERS

TYLER

Of course this is a University issue. 
There’s a code of ethics and an honor 
code and he violated them both.

SUMMERS

You entered into a code of ethics with 
the university, not with each other.

TYLER

(beat)

I’m sorry President Summers, what you 
just said makes no sense to me at all. 

I’m devastated by that.

SUMMERS

CAMERON

What my brother means is that if Mark 
Zuckerberg walked into our dorm room and 
stole our computer that would be a 
university issue, right?

SUMMERS

I really don’t know, this office doesn’t 
handle petty larceny.

This isn’t petty larceny.

TYLER

CAMERON

(calming)

Ty--

TYLER

This idea is potentially worth millions 
of dollars.

93.

Millions?

Yes.

SUMMERS

CAMERON

SUMMERS
You might be letting your imaginations 
run away with you.

TYLER

Sir, I honestly don’t think you’re in any 
position to make that call.

SUMMERS

I was U.S. Treasury Secretary, I’m in 
some position to make--

TYLER

Letting our imaginations run away with us 
is exactly what we were told to do in 
your freshmen address.

SUMMERS

Well I would suggest that you let your 
imaginations run away with you on a new 
project.

You would.

TYLER

SUMMERS

Yes. Everyone at Harvard is inventing 
something. Harvard undergraduates believe 
that inventing a job is better than 
finding a job so I’ll suggest again that 
the two of you come up with a new new

I’m sorry, but that’s not the point.

CAMERON

Please arrive at the point.

SUMMERS

CAMERON

You don’t have to be an intellectual 
property expert to understand the 
difference between right and wrong.

And you’re saying that I don’t?

SUMMERS

Of course I’m not saying that.

CAMERON

TYLER
I’m saying that.

Really.

Sir--

SUMMERS

CAMERON

Anne, how did they get this appointment?

SUMMERS

Colleagues of their father.

ANNE

SUMMERS gives a quick nod--that’s what he thought.

SUMMERS

Let me tell you something, Mr. Winklevoss 
and...Mr. Winklevoss. Since you’re on the 
subject of right and wrong. This action, 
this meeting, the two of you being here, 
is wrong. It’s not worthy of Harvard. 
It’s not what Harvard saw in you. You 
don’t get special treatment. 

We’ve never--

CAMERON

TYLER

Start another project? Like we’re making 
a diorama for the science fair?

SUMMERS

And if you have a problem with that, Mr. 
Winklevoss--

We’ve never asked for special treatment.

CAMERON

SUMMERS

--the courts are always at your disposal. 
Is there anything else I can do for you?

TYLER

(under his breath)

Well you could take the Harvard Student 
Handbook and shoved it up--

CAMERON
(stopping him)
(to SUMMERS)

Ty.
Thank you very much for your time, sir.

INT. SUMMERS OUTER OFFICE - DAY
As CAMERON and TYLER exit, TYLER closes the door a little too 
hard and the brass doorknob comes off in his hand. He drops it

GRETCHEN

Eduardo, spring break, you and Mr. 
Zuckerberg took a trip to New York.

Yes.

EDUARDO

What was the purpose of the trip?

GRETCHEN

EDUARDO

As CFO, I’d set up some meetings with 
potential advertisers.

Who paid for the trip?

GRETCHEN

EDUARDO

It was paid for out of the thousand 
dollar account I’d set up a few months 
earlier.

GRETCHEN

At this point your thousand dollars was 
the only money that had been put into the 
company.

Yes.

EDUARDO

How did you feel the meetings went?

GRETCHEN

EDUARDO

They went terribly.
GRETCHEN

Why?

Mark was asleep.

EDUARDO

I wasn’t asleep.

MARK

96.

Can I re-phrase my answer?

EDUARDO

Sure.

GRETCHEN

I wish he’d been asleep.

EDUARDO

CUT TO:
INT. AD EXECUTIVE’S OFFICE - DAY
EDUARDO, in a three-piece suit, is pitching the EXECUTIVE. 
MARK, in his hoodie and flip-flops, is completely detached and 
staring at the floor.

EDUARDO

...and we’re at 29 schools now with over 
75,000 members. People who go on 
theFacebook tend to stay on longer than 
almost any other site, now here’s the 
most impressive statistic--91% of people 
who try it once will come back. Now if 
you’ll allow me--

EXECUTIVE

(re: MARK)

Excuse me one second.
What sound is he making? Is that like a 
“tsk”.

MARK

It wasn’t a “tsk”, it was uh...hmm...like 
a glottal stop. Almost a gag reflex.

EXECUTIVE
Guys, what is this?

(beat)

CUT BACK TO:
INT. FIRST DEPOSITION ROOM - DAY

GRETCHEN
There was one more meeting scheduled for 
the New York trip.
EDUARDO

Yes. It was a dinner. It was set up 
through my girlfriend at the time.

GRETCHEN

Would you say that Mark was excited about 
this meeting?

97.

Yes, very.

EDUARDO

CUT TO:
INT. 66 - NIGHT
66 is a hip and trendy restaurant in Tribeca. The young crowd 
is drinking cocktails of all different colors and wearing 
Prada. We FIND EDUARDO in a three-piece suit and MARK in his 
hoodie and flip-flops, along with EDUARDO’s now-girlfriend, 
CHRISTY, sitting at a table with an empty seat waiting.

They’re not gonna card us.

CHRISTY

They might.

EDUARDO

Look around.

CHRISTY

It’ll be embarrassing.

EDUARDO

CHRISTY

(to MARK)

Tell him they’re not gonna card us.

They’re not gonna card us.

MARK

Mark--

EDUARDO

Are you gonna talk about ads again?

MARK

EDUARDO

Unless you’re the Ballet Theatre of 
Hartford, the purpose of a business is to 
make a profit.
MARK

This isn’t a business yet.

EDUARDO

That’s tough for me because my job is to--
nevermind.
MARK says nothing...

EDUARDO (CONT’D)

(pause)

He’s 25 minutes late.

MARK

He founded Napster when he was 19, he can 
be late.

EDUARDO

He’s not a god.
MARK

What is he?

25 minutes late.

EDUARDO

I think Wardo’s jealous.

CHRISTY

CUT BACK TO:
INT. FIRST DEPOSITION ROOM - DAY

I honestly wasn’t jealous. I was nervous.

EDUARDO

Why?

GRETCHEN

EDUARDO

I didn’t know him at all but I’d done a 
search and I’d asked around. He struck me 
as kind of a wild card.

CUT BACK TO:
INT. 66 - NIGHT

Why?

CHRISTY

EDUARDO

He crashed out of two pretty big internet 
companies in spectacular fashion and he’s 
had a reputation with drugs.

He also founded the companies.

MARK

EDUARDO
We don’t need him.

MARK

(nodding toward the door)

He’s here.

SEAN PARKER has stepped into the restaurant and is saying 
hello to the hostess while hugging a waitress.

99.

And he does own a watch.

EDUARDO

SEAN stops at a table to shake hands with a guy in a suit and 
kiss his girlfriend. It’s sort of an incongruous sight--this 
22 year old kid who’s able to work a room like Sinatra. Who 
the hell is this?

EDUARDO (CONT’D)

(quietly)

Take your time. And he does own a watch.

Stop it.

CHRISTY

SEAN makes his way over to MARK’s table--

I’m Sean Parker.

SEAN

EDUARDO

(shaking hands)

How do you do.
SEAN

You must be Eduardo. And Christy. And 
Mark, it’s great to meet you.

MARK

(almost beaming)

Great to meet you.

SEAN

You guys don’t have anything in front of 
you.
Tori.

(to a passing WAITRESS)

We were waiting for--

EDUARDO

Hey baby boy.

WAITRESS

SEAN

Can you bring out some things. The 
lacquered pork with that ginger confit? 
Tuna tartar and a lobster claws, that’ll 
get us started. Christy, what do you like 
to drink?

An appletini?

CHRISTY

Great. Four of those.

SEAN

CUT TO:
INT. FIRST DEPOSITION ROOM - DAY

EDUARDO

From that point on it was the Sean-a-

SY

The question was “What did you talk 
about?”

EDUARDO

He took us through his episode with 
Napster.

CUT TO:
INT. 66 - NIGHT
The CAMERA is moving around the table as SEAN--in and out of 
MOS--is telling story after story while food is brought, 
drinks put down, more food brought and more drinks put down. 
MARK is enthralled, CHRISTY is sexy and EDUARDO is polite.

SEAN

I didn’t want to spend my 20’s as a 
professional defendant. Who knew--the 
music industry doesn’t have a sense of 
humor. We tried to sell the company to 
pay the 35 million they said we owed in 
royalties but I guess to them that was a 
little like selling a stolen car to pay 
for the stolen gas. So we said screw it 
and declared bankruptcy.

But you made a name for yourself.

CHRISTY

And you are dry. Tori?

SEAN

No, I’m good.

CHRISTY

INT. FIRST DEPOSITION ROOM - DAY

EDUARDO (V.O.)

And then he went on to his second 
business venture, which was an online 
rolodex that he got thrown out of by Case 
Equity.

INT. 66 - NIGHT

SEAN

And I wanted to do it nice this time. I 
put on a tie and I shined my shoes but 
nobody wants to take orders from a kid so 
let me tell you what happens to a 20 year 
old at the top of a hot dot com:

CUT BACK TO:
INT. FIRST DEPOSITION ROOM - DAY

I’m not a psychiatrist, but--

EDUARDO

I’m glad we’ve got that on the record.

SY

You’re not a psychiatrist but what?

GRETCHEN

A psychiatrist would say he was paranoid.

EDUARDO

CUT BACK TO:
INT. 66 - NIGHT

SEAN

They’ll hire private detectives who’ll 
follow you day and night. You’re a target 
for high priced escorts. I can’t prove it 
but I know they tapped my phones. 
Whatever it is that’s gonna trip you up 
you’ve done already. Private behavior is 
a relic of a time gone by. And if 
somehow, someway, you’ve managed to live 
your life like the Dalai Lama then 
they’ll make shit up. Because they don’t 
want you, they want your idea and then 
they want you to say thank you while you--
excuse me--wipe your chin and walk away.

That’s what happened to you?

MARK

CUT BACK TO:
INT. FIRST DEPOSITION ROOM - DAY

And delusional.

EDUARDO

CUT BACK TO:

102.

INT. 66 - NIGHT

SEAN

Yes. There‘ll be payback at Case. I 
brought down the record companies with 
Napster and Case’s gonna suffer for their 
sins too.

EDUARDO

You didn’t bring down the record 
companies. They won.

In court.

Yes.

SEAN

EDUARDO

You want to buy a Tower Records, Eduardo?

SEAN

INT. FIRST DEPOSITION ROOM - DAY

EDUARDO (V.O.)

And he told story after story about life 
in Silicon Valley, and parties at Stanford 
and down in LA, and friends who’d become 
millionaires, but mostly how Mark had to--
had to come to California. And then he got 
around to theFacebook.

INT. 66 - NIGHT

Tell me about your progress.

SEAN

EDUARDO

Well...we’re in 29 schools now and we 
have over 75,000 members--

SEAN

(ignoring EDUARDO and going for 
MARK)

Tell me about the strategy you’re using.

MARK

Okay. For instance, we wanted Baylor in 
Texas but Baylor already had a social 
network on campus so instead of going 
right after them, we made a list of every 
school within a hundred miles--

SEAN

--and put theFacebook on those campuses 
first. 

103.

MARK

Pretty soon all the Baylor kids were 
seeing their friends on our site we were 
in. 

SEAN

That’s called the Little Big Horn, that’s 
smart, Mark.

Thank you, it was mine.

EDUARDO

CHRISTY

(to EDUARDO)

Easy.

EDUARDO

Settle an argument for us, would you? I 
say it’s time to start making money from 
theFacebook but Mark doesn’t want 
advertising. Who’s right?

SEAN

Neither of you yet. TheFacebook is cool, 
that’s what it’s got going for it.

Yeah.

MARK

SEAN

You don’t want to ruin it with ads 
because ads aren’t cool.

Exactly.

MARK

SEAN

It’s like you’re throwing the greatest 
party on campus and someone’s telling you 
it’s gotta be over at 11:00.

That’s exactly right.

MARK

SEAN

You don’t even know what the thing is 
yet.

I said exactly that.

MARK

SEAN

How big it can get and how far it can go. 
This is no time to take your chips down. 
A million dollars isn’t cool. You know 
what’s cool?

104.

You?

EDUARDO

CUT BACK TO:
INT. FIRST DEPOSITION ROOM - DAY

EDUARDO
A billion dollars.
And that shut everybody up.

(beat)

CUT BACK TO:
INT. 66 - NIGHT

SEAN

And that’s where you’re headed. A billion 
dollar valuation. Unless you take bad 
advice in which case you may as well have 
come up with a chain of very successful 
yogurt shops. When you go fishing you can 
catch a lot of fish or you can catch a 
big fish. You ever walk into a guy’s den 
and see a picture of him standing next to 
fourteen trout? 

No, he’s holding a 3000 pound marlin.

CHRISTY

Yep.

SEAN

That’s a good analogy.

MARK

EDUARDO

Okay, but we all know that marlins don’t 
really weigh 3000 pounds, right?

Have you seen the big ones up close?

CHRISTY

EDUARDO

I haven’t but I don’t think the guy’s 
holding a marlin the size of a Range 
Rover. That would be a really big fish 
and a very strong guy.

CHRISTY

You think we might be getting away from 
the point?

105.

SEAN

I don’t have a dog in this fight. I’m 
just a fan who came to say hi.

CUT TO:
INT. FIRST DEPOSITION ROOM - DAY

He owned Mark after that dinner. 

EDUARDO

CUT BACK TO:
INT. 66 - NIGHT
SEAN’s signing the check.

EDUARDO (V.O.)

He picked up the check, he told Mark 
they’d talk again soon and he was gone. 
But not before he made his biggest 
contribution to the company.

SEAN

(signing the check)

Drop the “the”. Just Facebook. It’s 
cleaner.

And SEAN heads out, patting backs and kissing waitresses along 
the way.
After a moment...

MARK

(knocked out)

Shit.

INT. NY TAXICAB - NIGHT

EDUARDO

That’s gotta be some kind of land speed 
record for talking.

You want to end the party at eleven.

MARK

I’m trying to pay for the party.

EDUARDO

MARK

(beat)

There won’t be a party unless it’s cool.
What’d you think?
EDUARDO

Sure, let’s drop the “the”.

MARK

I meant catching the marlin instead of 
the 14 trout. Doesn’t that sound good?

EDUARDO
If you’re a trout.

CUT TO:
INT. FIRST DEPOSITION ROOM - DAY

GRETCHEN

I’m going to enter this into the record. 
Incorporation papers for Facebook, an LLC 
registered in Florida--
Why Florida?

(to EDUARDO for the record)

That’s where my family lives.

EDUARDO

GRETCHEN

--and ask the respondent to stipulate 
that the articles of incorporation state 
the ownership as follows: 65 percent for 
Mark Zuckerberg, 30 percent for Eduardo 
Saverin and 5 percent for Dustin 
Moskovitz.

SY
We stipulate.

And that was April 13th, 2004. 

GRETCHEN

You can mark it.

SY

GRETCHEN

Do you have anything here?

SY

Yes, thank you. Mr. Saverin, have you 
ever done anything that might be 
considered legitimate grounds for 
termination?

No.

The dining hall was serving chicken for 
dinner and I had to feed my chicken so I 
just...I took little pieces of chicken 
and I gave it to the chicken. Someone 
must have seen me because the next thing 
I knew I was being accused of forced 
cannibalism.

At the end of the table, MARYLIN tries but fails to stifle a 
small laugh.
EDUARDO looks down the table...MARYLIN does her best to look 
serious.

EDUARDO (CONT’D)

I didn’t know you can’t do that. I dealt

dealt with the Associate Dean of the 
College, this was all resolved.

Alright, let’s just forget about it.

This is absurd. I’m being accused of 
animal cruelty. It’s better to be accused 
of necrophilia.

EDUARDO’s referring to a laptop that’s open and displaying 
images of four paintings.
MARK

I have my final coming up for “Postwar 
and Contemporary Art” and I haven’t been 
to class. I’m supposed to write about 
those four paintings.

That’s a Facebook page.

going.

Mr. Zuckerberg was cheating on his final

Well you just told us he was cheating.

GRETCHEN

EDUARDO

(to MARK)

Oops.
You told your lawyers I was torturing 
animals?!

INT. COMPUTER SCIENCE BUILDING/BASEMENT CORRIDOR - NIGHT
EDUARDO steps through double doors and stops for a moment as 
he HEARS an odd sound--RAUCOUS CHEERING from a CROWD that’s 
gathered in one of the classrooms.       
EDUARDO walks down to the classroom, opens the door and walks 
into--
INT. CLASSROOM - NIGHT
--where 60 or so STUDENTS are in a semi-circle, five and six 
deep, cheering on the contestants for the internship.
All the desks in the room have been moved to the sides and 
five desks with laptops set up in the middle. Next to each 
laptop is a shot glass filled with Jack Daniels.
DUSTIN’s holding a watch and MARK is walking slowly back and 
forth behind the five “interviewees” who are intensely typing 
at their keyboards.
EDUARDO slowly makes his way through the crowd to MARK. He can 
see that on the computer screens are a whole lot of numbers 
and letters that neither he nor we can understand. 

He stands next to MARK and watches this for a moment. Every 
once in a while, one of the contestants will throw back their 
shot of Jack Daniels which will instantly get re-filled by a 
PRETTY ASIAN GIRL. Throughout all this the CHEERING CONTINUES.

114.

DUSTIN

(waving EDUARDO over)

Eduardo!

EDUARDO

(pause)

Yo. Mark?

Yeah.

MARK

What’s goin’ on?

EDUARDO

MARK

They have 10 minutes to get root access 
to a Python webserver, expose its SSL 
encryption and then intercept all traffic 
over its secure port.

They’re hacking.

EDUARDO

MARK

Yes, all behind a Pix Firewall Emulator. 
But here’s the beauty.

EDUARDO
You know I didn’t understand anything you 
just said, right?

MARK
I do know that.

EDUARDO
What’s the beauty?

MARK

Every 10th line of code written, they 
have to drink a shot. And hacking’s 
supposed to be stealth, so anytime the 
server detects an intrusion, the 
candidate responsible has to drink a 
shot. I also have a program running that 
has a pop-up window appear simultaneously 
on all five computers--the last candidate 
to hit the window has to drink a shot. 
Plus every three minutes they all have to 
drink a shot.

DUSTIN
(calling out)

Three minutes.

All five candidates drain their shot glasses and slam them 
down where they get re-filled by the pretty Asian girl.

EDUARDO

Can I ask--what part of the interns’ jobs 
will they need to be able to do drunk?

115.

MARK

You’re right. A more relevant test might 
be seeing if they can keep a chicken 
alive for a week.
That was mean.

(pause)

EDUARDO hands MARK a thick envelope--

Here.

EDUARDO

What’s this?

MARK

EDUARDO

I opened a new account and put $18,000 in 
it. Will that get you through the summer?

MARK looks at EDUARDO...
Suddenly two of the candidates hands shoot up almost at the 
same time--

Here!

INTERN [ERIC]

Right here!

INTERN [IAN]

MARK glances over at the first screen, then the second...

Welcome to Facebook.

The place ERUPTS. The pretty ASIAN GIRL hits an mp3 player 
that’s been hooked up to speakers and a Dr. Dre song blares 
out--”California, it’s time to party...”

GRETCHEN (CONT’D)

(to EDUARDO)

After expressing misgivings about Mr. 
Zuckerberg taking the company and moving 
it to California for the summer, why did 
you put $18,000 in an account for his 
use?

EDUARDO

I figured we were partners and I wanted 
to be a team player. I figured Mark, 
Dustin and the new interns could work on 
the site while I was generating 
advertiser interest in New York. But 
mostly I figured...how much could go 
wrong in three months?

EXT. PALO ALTO HOUSE - DAY
We’re outside of this small, campus-area house as LOUD MUSIC 
plays. A zip line is tied from the chimney and runs down over 
a small swimming pool where it’s attached to a telephone pole 
on the other side.
MARK is standing in the pool and video taping as DUSTIN, who’s 
on the roof, grabs the handle, takes off and jumps into the 
pool to everyone’s cheers.
We HEAR the GUYS joke about the quality of the jump.
The handle gets pulled back on a rope, an INTERN grabs it, 
jumps--

The INTERN drops into patio furniture as bricks from the 
chimney come cascading down.
No one moves--

I’m okay.

You sure?

Yeah.

Yikes.

INTERN [ERIC]

MARK

ERIC

DUSTIN

And at that moment a stray brick drops from the roof and 
crashes through a glass patio table.
From inside the DOORBELL RINGS--

That’s the doorbell.

DUSTIN (CONT’D)

I didn’t know we had a doorbell.

MARK

DUSTIN

(shouting inside)
Andrew! Get the door!

No, he’s wired in.

MARK

INTERN [IAN]

That’s gonna cut into the security 
deposit.

118.

MARK walks into--
INT. PALO ALTO HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
The place is computer geek paradise. Computers are everywhere, 
along with some of the empty boxes they came in. Pizza boxes, 
Chinese food containers, empty beer bottles and white boards 
filled with indecipherable code fill the room. There are a 
couple of large mattresses on the floor and a large map of the 
U.S. with pins and tags showing the schools where they’ve 
already put Facebook and different pins showing the schools 
they’re going for.
As MARK walks to the door, he walks past ANDREW, who’s sitting 
at a computer, writing code and completely oblivious to 
everything around him.

MARK

(snapping his fingers)

Andrew.

Not now.

Good boy.

ANDREW

MARK

MARK gets to the door and opens it.
He’s stunned to see SEAN PARKER standing there with his 
girlfriend, SHARON.
They all look at each other for a moment--

Sean?

MARK (CONT’D)

Mark? Do you live here?

SEAN

Yeah. Do you?

MARK

SEAN

We were right across the street, we saw 
the chimney come--

Yeah.

MARK

Is anybody hurt?

SEAN

No. You live across the street?

MARK

119.

I’m Sharon.

SHARON

SEAN

This is my--Sharon. She lives across the 
street I was helping her move out when we 
saw the chimney--

Yeah, we had a zip line to the pool.

MARK

You came to California.

SEAN

Yeah.

MARK

You made the right choice.

SEAN

CUT TO:
INT. PALO ALTO HOUSE - LATER
SEAN’s looking around the place. DUSTIN and the INTERNS are 
standing off to the side, happy to be in the presence of Sean 
Parker. ANDREW’s still locked into his computer. MARK’s off in 
the kitchen.

Here you go.

MARK (OS)

A beer comes flying out of the kitchen and SEAN catches it.

Sharon.

MARK (OS) (CONT’D)

Another beer comes flying out which SHARON had no idea was 
coming and so it smashes into the fireplace.

SHARON

(pause)

I’m so sorry. I didn’t know you were--

MARK (OS)

(calling)

No problem. Here you go.

Wait--

SHARON

And another bottle comes flying out that SHARON isn’t ready 
for and it crashes to the floor.

This house and this team are great. It’s 
exactly what it should be.

SEAN

(MORE)

SEAN (CONT'D)

(to ANDREW)
I’m Sean Parker.

ANDREW pays no attention as MARK comes out of the kitchen--

120.

MARK
He’s wired in.
SEAN

That’s what I’m talkin’ about. Where’s 
Eduardo?

He’s got an internship in New York.

MARK

SEAN

(beat)

Eduardo didn’t come out?

MARK shakes his head, “No.”
CUT TO:
INT. RUBY SKYE - CONTINUOUS
An ultra-hip San Francisco nightclub. It’s a hundred-year old 
theater that’s been converted into a 21st Century hot spot for 
Silicon Valley’s rock stars. The lower level is a giant dance 
floor packed with sweating 20-somethings bouncing to pounding 
house music. There are raised blocks where scantily dressed 
professional dancers perform non-stop. A huge lighting grid 
hangs from the ceiling shooting colored lights and lasers 
everywhere. Also hanging from the ceiling are two trapeze bars 
with two performers swinging and contorting.
The staircase leads up to the 2nd level which is all VIP 
tables that look out over the dance floor. Each VIP area has a 
couple of couches and a table covered in bottles of vodka, 
tequila, rum, mixers, ice, glasses and a private waitress 
who’s happy to bend over and pour a drink for you.
And that’s where we catch up with MARK and SEAN. Sitting next 
to SEAN is a BEAUTIFUL WOMAN and there’s another standing 
behind him and leaning against the couch.        
MARK and SEAN have to speak up above the music.

SEAN

I was crashing there for a little bit 
while I’m taking care of some things. But 
she’s done for the summer so she’s back 
at her parents’ place.

The homeless rock star of Palo Alto.

BEAUTIFUL WOMAN #1 (BRIANNA)

121.

What’s your plan for the summer?

SEAN

MARK has been subtly checking out the club and not paying 
attention.

Mark?

SEAN (CONT’D)

MARK

I’m sorry, I was looking at the 
architecture.

SEAN smiles...

I asked what your plan--

SEAN

MARK

A hundred schools by the end of the 
summer.

I’m going to the restroom.

BRIANNA

Okay.

SEAN

I’ll go with you.

BEAUTIFUL WOMAN #2 (KELSEY)

The two girls exit--

Your date looks so familiar to me.

MARK

She looks familiar to a lot of people.

SEAN

What do you mean?

MARK

SEAN takes a sip of his drink...

SEAN

(simply)

A Stanford MBA named Roy Raymond wants to 
buy his wife some lingerie but he’s too 
embarrassed to shop for it in a 
department store. He comes up with an 
idea for a high end place that doesn’t 
make you feel like a pervert. He gets a 
$40,000 bank loan and borrows another 
forty-thousand from his in-laws, opens a 
store and calls it Victoria’s Secret. He 
makes a half-million dollars his first 
year. 

(MORE)

122.

SEAN (CONT'D)

He starts a catalogue, opens three more 
stores and after five years, he sells the 
company to Leslie Wexner and The Limited 
for four million dollars. Happy ending, 
right? Except two years later the 
company’s worth 500 million dollars and 
Roy Raymond jumps off the Golden Gate 
Bridge. 
Poor guy just wanted to buy his wife a 
pair of thigh-highs, you know?

(beat)

Was that a parable?

MARK

SEAN

My date’s a Victoria’s Secret model, 
that’s why she looks familiar to you.

God.

MARK

SEAN

Don’t be impressed by all this, I read 
your blog. 

Oh, you know, that was--

MARK

SEAN

You know why I started Napster? A girl I 
loved in high school was with the co-
captain of the varsity lacrosse team and 
I wanted to take her from him so I 
decided to come up with the next big 
thing. 

I didn’t know th--

MARK

SEAN

Napster wasn’t a failure. I changed the 
music industry for better and for always. 
It may not have been good business but it 
pissed a lot of people off. And wasn’t 
that what your Facemash was about? 
They’re scared of me, pal,  and they’re 
gonna be scared of you. What the VC’s 
want is to say, “Good idea, kid. The 
grown-ups’ll take it from here.” But not 
this time. This is our time. This time 
you’re gonna hand ‘em a business card 
that says “I’m CEO...bitch”, that’s what 
I want for you, so where the hell’s 
Eduardo?

He’s in New York.

MARK

123.

Suckin’ up to ad execs.

SEAN

He’s got an--

MARK

SEAN

--an internship? The company’s here. A 
billion dollar company is here. Do you 
live and breathe Facebook?

Yes.

MARK

SEAN

Wardo wants to be a businessman and for 
all I know he’s gonna be a good one but 
he shouldn’t be in New York kissing 
Madison Avenue’s ass. This is a once-in-a-
generation-holy-shit idea and the water 
under the Golden Gate is freezing cold. 
Look at my face and tell me I don’t know 
what I’m talking about.

MARK

(pause)

Do you ever think about the girl?

What girl?

SEAN

MARK

The one--the girl in high school who was--
with the lacrosse thing.

SEAN

(are you kidding?)

No.

The girls comes back--

BRIANNA

If you guys are gonna talk about 
bandwidth we need shots.

SEAN

A hundred schools by the end of the 
summer?

Yeah.

MARK

SEAN

Tell you what, gesture of good faith. 
While you’re getting into a hundred 
schools, I’ll put you on two continents.

124.

MARK

If you don’t have a place to crash I 
think you should definitely come and live 
with us.

SEAN

(nods)
Let’s line up some shots.
(getting the server)
Excuse me.

Yes sir.

SERVER 

SEAN

You can take this away and bring out the 
1942.

Absolutely, Mr. Parker.

SERVER 

MARK takes this in a moment before we
CUT TO:
EXT. THE THAMES - DAY
We’re looking at a stone bridge crossing a perfectly straight 
stretch of water against the backdrop of the medieval town of 
Henley, England--founded in 1179.
And after a moment of placid quiet--
--BOOSH!
Two razor thin skulls explode for the final, agonizing hundred-
meter stretch of the ancient and prestigious Henley Royal 
Regatta.
The two boats are neck and neck. The port-side boat is being 
crewed by the two Dutch members of the Hollandia Roeiclub. The 
starboard boat is being crewed by a pair of identical twins 
wearing tank tops bearing the “H” of Harvard.
We HEAR the ROAR come up from the CROWD in the viewing 
section. The crowd is dressed as if for opening day at Ascot--
the women in flowing dresses and wide-brimmed hats, the men in 
blazers and brightly colored floral ties.
But the young men in the boats can barely hear the crowd. Just 
their own breathing as they pull against the longest natural 
straight stretch of water in the world--a mile and a half 
torture test against the best competition they’ve ever faced.
And they’re neck and neck. CAMERON and TYLER can’t shake the 
Dutch.

125.

The CROWD is going crazy. Mixed in with the British crowd is a 
small contingent waving the flag of Holland and a slightly 
larger contingent of Americans.
We’ll notice a stoic man in a VIP viewing section and later 
we’ll be introduced to him as Cameron and Tyler’s father. Next 
to him is their mother, who can barely watch.
Back on the boats it’s just the breathing as the skulls slice 
through the water like jet-powered knives. 50 meters now and 
there’s still no daylight between them.
25 meters and the Dutch and American fans are going crazy--
even the British aristocracy can’t help but get caught up in 
the closest race in the history of the competition. The FATHER 
is silently willing his boys one more fraction of boat speed--
the MOTHER has her hands over her mouth in praying position.
POP!
--the finish gun is fired into the air, the oars come out of 
the water and the bodies of the crewmen slump over.
CAMERON turns his head to the cheering crowd to see the Dutch 
group holding a giant flag and jumping up and down. The 
Americans bring their giant flag down and fold it up.
The two DUTCH CREW MEMBERS pump their fists in the air and hug 
as the two boats skim along to a gentle stop.
The MOTHER drops her head and looks down. The FATHER refuses 
to look away.
From CAMERON and TYLER, just the breathing.
CUT TO:
INT. AWARD CEREMONY - DAY
CAMERON and TYLER are watching as the Dutch team is having 
their picture taken with their newly-won trophy in the press 
room. TYLER doesn’t want to watch anymore and steps into--
INT. RECEPTION ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Where an AIDE greets him--

AIDE
Mr. Winklevoss.
TYLER

Tyler.

Tremendous race.

AIDE

126.

Thank you. 

TYLER

CAMERON comes along.

This is my brother, Cameron.

TYLER (CONT’D)

Excellent.

AIDE

(to the blue-blazered man 
behind him)

Sir. His Royal Highness, Prince Albert.

Ah.

PRINCE ALBERT

AIDE

Your highness, this is Cameron and Tyler 
Winklevoss.

PRINCE ALBERT
Of course. Brilliant race. I’ve never 
seen a race that close.

TYLER

(beat)

Yes, sir.

PRINCE ALBERT

My grandfather, Jack Kelly, was one of 
the premiere rowers of his day. I’ve been 
coming to Henley for 30 years and I’ve 
never seen a race that close. Have you 
seen a race that close?

CAMERON is thinking about starting a war with Monaco right now 
so he lets his brother do the talking.

TYLER

(beat)

No, Your Highness. Mile and a half races 
are more commonly won by a boat length or 
two.

PRINCE ALBERT

Yes, that’s absolutely right. Brutally 
close.

TYLER
May I introduce my teammates? This is 
Dave, he’s our--

AIDE

(quietly to PRINCE ALBERT)

I’m sorry, you’ll have to excuse us.

On to the Dutch!

PRINCE ALBERT

CAMERON and TYLER step over to DIVYA who’s waiting near the 
bar--

127.

TYLER

I’m sorry you had to fly all the way over 
to see that.

DIVYA
I wouldn’t have missed it, brother. How 
was the royalty?

CAMERON

I just wanted him to tell me a couple 
more times how close the race was a 
couple of more times. Brutal. It was 
brutally close. Excruciatingly brutal. 
Never seen a race so excruciatingly 
JESUS!

That was an unusual outburst from CAMERON...

DIVYA

Cam, the guy’s the prince of a country 
the size of Nantucket, relax it’s fine--

MR. WINKLEVOSS has made his way over--

Boys.

Dad.

Divya.

MR. WINKLEVOSS

TYLER

MR. WINKLEVOSS

DIVYA
Mr. Winklevoss.

That was a tough beat. 

MR. WINKLEVOSS

I’m sorry, that you and mom flew all the--

CAMERON

MR. WINKLEVOSS

No, don’t you ever apologize to me for 
losing a race like that. Don’t ever 
apologize to anyone for losing a race 
like that.

Another man comes along, MR. KENWRIGHT.

128.

Boys.

KENWRIGHT

TYLER

Oh. Mr. Kenwright. Dad, this is Mr. 
Kenwright, the head of our host family 
this week.

Pleasure to meet you.

KENWRIGHT

Good to meet you.

MR. WINKLEVOSS

KENWRIGHT

I just had a phone chat with my daughter. 
She told me that she and her friends are 
already talking about the race, which 
they’ve seen via their computers. A new 
website called Facebook. Do you have this 
in America?
Everyone is frozen...

I’m going to find your mother.

MR. WINKLEVOSS

KENWRIGHT

(pause)

Have I said something wrong?

DIVYA

(pause)

Your daughter doesn’t go to school in the 
States?

KENWRIGHT

No no. Cambridge. Majoring in French 
Literature, though I wasn’t aware there 
was such a thing.

TYLER

(pause)

They have Facebook at Cambridge?

KENWRIGHT

And apparently Oxford and the London 
School of Economics--that’s where her 
friends are.

DIVYA
That’s awesome.

KENWRIGHT

Good race, boys. Take the bitter with the 
better.

The men leave and CAMERON, TYLER and DIVYA are alone. CAMERON 
looks at them for a moment...

129.

CAMERON

(pause)

I’m gonna watch the race film. If this 
online I wanna see it.

TYLER

Stop it. Stop it, Cameron. Knock it off. 
I don’t mind that we lost to the Dutch 
today by less than a second. That was a 
good race, that was a fair race and 
they’ll see us again. What I mind--and 
what you should mind--is showing up on 
Monday for a race that was run on Sunday. 
We tried talking to him ourselves, we 
tried writing a letter, we tried the Ad 
Board, and we tried the president of the 
University. Now I’m asking you. For the 
last time! Let’s take the considerable 
resources at our disposal and sue him in 
federal court!

(beat)

CAMERON looks at his brother and DIVYA...

Come on.

DIVYA

CAMERON

(pause)

I need a real drink.

CAMERON takes a few steps away as TYLER and DIVYA drop their 
heads in surrender but then CAMERON turns right back--

Screw it. Let’s gut the freakin’ nerd.

CAMERON (CONT’D)

DIVYA grabs CAMERON and hugs him.

That’s what I’m talking about.

INT. PALO ALTO HOUSE - NIGHT
There’s a thunderstorm going on outside and rain is beating 
hard against the windows. DUSTIN, ANDREW and the INTERNS are 
hard at work writing code. Green Day is pumping from the 
speakers.
SEAN is pacing the house on a cordless phone while two YOUNG 
WOMEN--dressed to go out for a party--are at the moment each 
on a free computer playing each other in a game of Counter-
Strike. Basically they’re shooting at each other and missing 
and laughing their heads off.

It wouldn’t appear as if the house has been cleaned since the 
last time we saw it and in fact there are signs of more 
wreckage as well as futons, pillows and blankets on the floor.
There’s also a 12-foot bong that reaches the middle landing of 
the staircase.

SEAN

Check it out, I saw him today.
Manningham, Mitchell Manningham, my Case 
Equity guy--hang on.
Are you guys using spikes or ghost 
missiles?

GIRL #1

We don’t know, we’re just shooting at 
each other.

The DOORBELL RINGS but no one pays attention--

Use sweet kamakazis.

Like we know what that is.

GIRL #1

Now there’s a KNOCKING at the door and we
CUT TO:
EXT. PALO ALTO HOUSE - NIGHT
Rain is soaking down on EDUARDO as he stands at the front door 
with a suitcase in his hand. A taxi is turning around in the 
driveway and heading off. EDUARDO knocks on the front door 
again as we
CUT BACK TO:
INT. PALO ALTO HOUSE - NIGHT

SEAN

I saw him getting into his turbo Carerra
and he saw me too, I know he did.
Don’t sweat it, I’m on a land line.

SEAN leans over one of the girls, casually hits a few keys and 
easily kills several of the other girl’s soldiers.

Yes!

Hey!

Bong hit!

GIRL #2

GIRL #1

She has to take one as a penalty.

Does, anybody hear that banging?

DUSTIN

SEAN
(to DUSTIN)

You don’t hear anything, you’re writing 
code.

Dude, somebody’s at the door.

DUSTIN

SEAN goes back to the phone conversation as he heads to the 
door--

SEAN

(into phone)

It’s not a dish best served cold. It’s 
best served immediately and relentlessly.

SEAN opens the door and the soaking wet EDUARDO is standing 
there...

SEAN (CONT’D)
I’m gonna call you back.
What’s up?

(into phone)
(to EDUARDO)

EDUARDO

(long pause)
What’s up?
(beat)
Mark was supposed to pick me up at the 
airport an hour ago, I’ve been calling 
his cell.

SEAN

He was on a 36 hour coding tear so he 
took a nap for a couple of hours.

EDUARDO walks into the house and surveys the wreckage--

What happened here?

EDUARDO

SEAN

Not happened--happening. The next big 
thing.

132.

Wardo!

Hey man.

DUSTIN

EDUARDO

SEAN
(to DUSTIN)

Back to work.

GIRL #2

The more bad I get at this, the more 
wasted I get. I meant the more--

SEAN
We understand.

How old are they, Sean?

EDUARDO

It’s not polite to ask.

SEAN

Sean, how old are they?

EDUARDO

You think you know me. Right?

SEAN

EDUARDO
I’ve read enough.

SEAN

You know how much I’ve read about you? 
Nothing.

MARK comes down the stairs--

Wardo.

MARK

I waited an hour for you at the airport.

EDUARDO

What time is it?

MARK

EDUARDO

It’s midnight. Or 3AM in New York where I 
just came from.
MARK

You’ve gotta see some of the new stuff 
we’ve got. Dustin, show him the wall. I’m 
just calling it the wall.

133.

SEAN

Forget the wall, tell him about the 
meeting I’ve got set up.
You know Peter Thiel?

(to EDUARDO)

No.

EDUARDO

SEAN

No reason you should. He just runs a two-
billion dollar hedge fund called Clarium 
Capital.

EDUARDO

(to MARK)

Why’s he setting up meetings?

MARK

Thiel may want to make an angel 
investment.

EDUARDO

I don’t care if he’s an actual angel, 
why’s he setting up business meetings?

You’ve had a long flight.

MARK

EDUARDO

No, I’ve had a long wait on the tarmac at 
JFK, then a long wait at the passenger 
loading and unloading zone at SFO and in 
between there was a long flight. I’m the 
business end of this company and he’s a 
house guest living here rent-free on a 
generous grant from the Eduardo Saverin 
Foundation. 

SEAN

I heard about your big ticket ad buys 
lined up.

Hey, man--

EDUARDO

SEAN

Gary’s Tuxedos, the Harvard Bartending 
Course. You’re just one small step away 
from bagging Snookies Cookies, I can feel 
it.

EDUARDO

(to MARK)

Want to talk to me alone for a minute?

Sure.

We’ve talked about this on the phone, 
were you even--I quit on my first day.

MARK

I do remember you saying that. How’s 
Christy?

Christy’s crazy.

EDUARDO

Is that fun?

MARK

EDUARDO

No I mean she’s actually psychotic. She’s 
insanely jealous, she’s irrational and 
I’m frightened of her.

Still, it’s nice you have a girlfriend.

MARK

EDUARDO

I do not want that guy representing 
himself as part of this company.

MARK

You gotta move out here, Wardo, this is 
where it’s all happening.

Did you hear what I just said?

EDUARDO

135.

The connections, the energy--

MARK

Mark--

EDUARDO

MARK

I’m afraid if you don’t come out here 
you’re going to get left behind. I want--
I want--I need you out here, please don’t 
tell him I said that.

What did you just say?

EDUARDO

MARK

It’s moving faster than any of us ever 
even imagined and--

What do you mean get left behind?

EDUARDO

MARK

It’s moving fast and Sean even thinks 
that--

Sean is not part of the company.

EDUARDO

MARK

We have over 300,000 members, Wardo, 
we’re in 160 schools including--

EDUARDO
I’m aware of that.

MARK

--five in Europe.
EDUARDO

I’m aware of that, Mark, I’m the CFO.

MARK

We need more servers than I ever imagined 
we’d need. We need more programmers. And 
we need more money. And he set up the 
Thiel meeting. He’s set up meetings all 
around town.

He’s set up other meetings?

EDUARDO

Yes.

MARK

Without me knowing anything about it?!

EDUARDO

You’re in New York!

I’m in New York riding subways 14 hours a

I got back this afternoon.

EDUARDO

Chris, it was kind of a rough trip and I 
was tired and--

CHRISTY

Or answer one of my 47 texts? Did you 
know I sent 47 texts?

EDUARDO

I did, and I thought that was incredibly 
normal behavior.

Are you mocking me?

I brought you a present.

of Facebook doesn’t know how to change 
his relationship status on Facebook?

EDUARDO

It’s a little embarrassing so you should 
take it as a sign of trust that I would 
tell you that.

Go to hell.

CHRISTY

EDUARDO

(calming)
Take it easy.

CHRISTY

No, you didn’t change it so you could 
screw Silicon Valley sluts every time you 
go out to see Mark.

EDUARDO

That is not even remotely true and I can 
promise you that the Silicon Valley sluts 
don’t care what anyone’s relationship 
status is on Facebook. Please, open your 
present.

EDUARDO’s cell phone RINGS--

140.

Oh, your phone does work.

CHRISTY

EDUARDO reaches for his cell but CHRISTY grabs it first to 
check the ID.

It’s Mark.

CHRISTY (CONT’D)

CHRISTY tosses the still ringing phone back to him--

EDUARDO

Okay, this is gonna be tricky. Here, open 
your present. It’s a silk scarf.

Have you ever seen me wear a scarf?

CHRISTY

This’ll be your first.

EDUARDO

EDUARDO’s gotten the gift box out of his half un-packed 
suitcase, tossed it to CHRISTY and finally answered the phone.

EDUARDO (CONT’D)

(into phone)

Yeah.

INTERCUT WITH:
INT. PALO ALTO HOUSE - SAME TIME

MARK

(into his cell phone)

You froze our account?

In the background there’s a small celebration going on with 
SEAN, DUSTIN, the INTERNS and of course some GIRLS. Champagne 
is being sprayed from shaken bottles and the girls are dancing 
to triumphant music.

I did.

EDUARDO

You froze the account.

MARK

I had to get your attention, Mark.

EDUARDO

MARK

Do you realize that you jeopardized the 
entire company? Do you realize that your 
actions could have permanently destroyed 
everything I’ve been working on?

141.

We’ve been working on.

EDUARDO

MARK

Without money, the site can’t function. 
Let me tell you the difference between 
Facebook and everybody else: WE DON’T 
CRASH EVER!

What EDUARDO can’t see behind his back is that CHRISTY has 
taken the gift box and lit it on fire with a cigarette 
lighter.

MARK (CONT’D)

If the servers are down for even a day, 
our entire reputation is irreversibly 
destroyed. Users are fickle. Friendster 
has proven that fact.

And CHRISTY’s now dropped the flaming cardboard box into the 
wastebasket where the fire grows larger. She casually kicks 
the basket over with her foot.

Look--

EDUARDO

MARK

Even a few people leaving would 
reverberate through the entire user base. 
The users are interconnected, that’s the 
whole point! College kids are online 
because their friends are online and if 
one domino goes, all the dominos go! Do 
you get that?! I’m not going back to 
Caribbean Night at A-E-Pi!

EDUARDO

(finally seeing the fire)
(to CHRISTY)

Holy shit!
What is wrong with you?

MARK

Did you like being nobody?! Did you like 
being a joke?! Do you wanna go back to 
that?!

EDUARDO
Hang on, hang on.

EDUARDO hits a button on his cell and tosses it down. We’ll 
keep hearing MARK’s voice as EDUARDO runs out into the 
hallway, grabs a fire extinguisher from its wall bracket, 
comes back in and sprays out the fire.

That was the act of a child, not a 
businessman. 

MARK

(MORE)

142.

MARK (CONT'D)

And it certainly wasn’t the act of a 
friend. You know how embarrassed I was 
for me to try and cash a check today? I’m 
not going back to that life.
Maybe you were frustrated. 

(beat)

EDUARDO

(shouting)

Yeah!

Maybe you were angry.

MARK

EDUARDO
(calling out)

I was!

MARK

But I’m willing to let bygones be bygones 
because, Wardo, I’ve got some good news.
EDUARDO--with the fire now out--picks up the phone.

EDUARDO

I’m sorry. I was angry and maybe it was 
childish. But I had to get your 
attention.

Wardo, I said I’ve got some good news.

MARK

What is it?

EDUARDO

MARK

Peter Thiel’s just made an angel 
investment of a half a million dollars.

EDUARDO

(pause)

What?

MARK

A half a million dollars and he’s setting 
us up in an office. They want to re-
incorporate the company, they want to 
meet you they need your signature on some 
documents so get your ass on the next 
flight back to San Francisco. 
I need my CFO.

(beat)

EDUARDO
(beat--smiles)

I’m on my way.

143.

Wardo.

Yeah.

MARK

EDUARDO

We did it.

MARK

EDUARDO clicks the phone shut. After a moment...

CHRISTY

(like nothing’s happened)

Wardo?

And EDUARDO jumps because CHRISTY was standing behind him--

Aaggh!

EDUARDO

You going back there already?

CHRISTY

Yes. Also I’m breaking up with you.

EDUARDO

CUT TO:
INT. FACEBOOK OFFICE - DAY
A glass conference room in the corner of a glass bullpen on a 
high floor of a high rise.
Cartons are being unpacked, computers are everywhere along 
with bags of potato chips and boxes of cereal.
In the conference room, EDUARDO is sitting with three LAWYERS 
at a round, glass table and documents have been put out in 
front of him.
We can see through the glass that MARK is working at a 
computer nearby. SEAN is also hovering in the background.

LAWYER

Four documents. The first two are common 
stock purchase agreements allowing you to 
buy stock in the newly re-incorporated 
Facebook as opposed to the old shares 
which are now worthless. The third is the 
exchange agreement, allowing you to 
exchange the old shares for new shares 
and then finally a voter holding 
agreement.

How many shares of stock will I own?

EDUARDO

144.

1,328,334.

LAWYER

Jesus Christ.

EDUARDO

LAWYER

That represents a 34.4% ownership share. 
Why the increase from the original 30%? 

EDUARDO

Because you may need to dilute it to 
award shares to new investors.

I like working with business majors.

LAWYER

Economics.

EDUARDO

LAWYER #2

You should know that Mark’s already taken 
his percentage from 60 down to 51.

EDUARDO

Mark doesn’t care about money and he 
needs to be protected. 

LAWYER

Dustin Moskovitz owns 6.81%, Sean Parker 
6.47%--

I can live with that.

EDUARDO

LAWYER

And Peter Theil 7%. Would you like to use 
my pen?

CUT TO:
INT. FIRST DEPOSITION ROOM - EVENING
It’s dusk now and the sky outside the room is turning purple. 
EDUARDO seems lost in thought.

GRETCHEN

(helping)

Eduardo?

EDUARDO looks up.

EDUARDO

(pause)

Could you please repeat the question?

145.

SY

No. It was an outrageously leading 
question the first time around and now 
you want us to hear it again?

Yes, would you read it back, please.

GRETCHEN

Well, go ahead.

SY

COURT REPORTER

Counsel: “And when you signed these 
documents, were you aware that you were 
signing your own death certificate?”

EDUARDO

(pause)
(pause)

No.
It was insanely stupid of me not to have 
my own lawyers look over all the...the, 
uh...in all honesty I thought they were
my lawyers.
I was your only friend. You had one 
friend.
My father won’t even look at me.

(then to MARK)

(beat)

GRETCHEN

(beat)

Okay. Eduardo? Did Mr. Zuckerberg say 
anything to you after you signed the 
papers?

EDUARDO

There was a lot of handshaking and a lot 
of congratulations. He’d already told me 
that he wouldn’t be coming back to school 
for at least a semester so we were saying 
goodbye for a while. And then before I 
left, he said--

CUT TO:
INT. FACEBOOK OFFICE - DAY

MARK

But you gotta come back. Somewhere around 
the end of November/early December. Peter 
wants to throw us an amazing party when 
we hit a million members, it’s gonna be 
out of control. You’ve gotta come back 
for it.

146.

EDUARDO
A million members.

(quietly can’t believe it)

Yeah.

MARK

EDUARDO

Remember the algorithm on the window at 
Kirkland?

Yeah.

MARK

Yeah, I’ll be here.

EDUARDO

CUT TO:
EXT. SAN FRANCISCO STREET - DAY
A brand new black Escalade pulls up in front of a gleaming 
glass and chrome office building. SEAN is at the wheel and 
MARK, in the passenger seat, is wearing brightly colored 
pajamas with his hair a mess.
They get out of the car and huddle on the sidewalk.

You sure about this?

MARK

SEAN

You’re 20 minutes late. You’re going to 
walk in there and say you overslept and 
you didn’t have time to get dressed. 
They’re gonna pitch you. Case Equity is 
gonna pitch you. They’re gonna beg you to 
take their money. You’re gonna nod, 
you’re gonna nod, you’re gonna nod and 
then you’re gonna say, “Which one of you 
is Roth--” No, not Roth, Manningham. 
“Which one of you is Mitchell 
Manningham?”. And he’ll say, “I am”. And 
you say, “Sean Parker says ‘Fuck you’ and 
on walk out.

MARK

(pause)

Okay.

CUT TO:

147.

INT. FIRST DEPOSITION ROOM - EVENING

EDUARDO

In late November I got the e-mail from 
Mark telling me to come out for the 
millionth member party.

What else did the e-mail say?

GRETCHEN

EDUARDO

It said that we had to have a business 
meeting. That Mark and Sean had played 
some kind of revenge stunt on Case Equity 
and that Manningham was so impressed that 
he was making an investment offer that 
was hard to turn down.

CUT TO:
INT. NEW FACEBOOK OFFICES - NIGHT

EDUARDO (V.O.)

I went out to California and I went 
straight to the new offices.

And it’s clear that we’re in the offices of a new, high-tech, 
very successful internet company. The Facebook logo in blue 
metallic letters on the wall, the maple desks, new computer 
monitors, carpeting, a wall covered in graffiti by an artist 
commissioned for the job and tons of young employees.

EDUARDO (V.O.)

I didn’t know whether to dress for the 
party or for the business meeting so I 
kind of dressed for both.

We see that most of the employees, especially the women, are 
dressed to go to an after-work, late-night party.

But it didn’t matter.

EDUARDO (V.O.)

Why not?

GRETCHEN (V.O.)

EDUARDO (V.O.)

Because I wasn’t called out there for 
either one.

CUT TO:
INT. FIRST DEPOSITION ROOM - EVENING

What were you called out there for?

GRETCHEN

148.

An ambush.

EDUARDO

CUT BACK TO:
INT. NEW FACEBOOK OFFICES - NIGHT

LAWYER
Mr. Saverin, hey.

EDUARDO turns to see the LAWYER he dealt with earlier standing 
by the door to a glass conference room.

LAWYER (CONT’D)
In here. Right over here.

EDUARDO walks across the bullpen, where no one makes eye 
contact, and into--
INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

EDUARDO (V.O.)

At first I thought he was joking, giving 
me more contracts to sign. But then I 
started reading.

As EDUARDO reads, we rack focus to MARK, who’s sitting at a 
computer with his back to EDUARDO, focused on his work.
And then we see SEAN step into the frame and lean against a 
desk a few yards away.
And then back to EDUARDO, who’s almost shaking...

Wait, what is this?

EDUARDO

LAWYER

Well, as you know we had some new 
investors--

What is this?

EDUARDO

LAWYER

If you’ll let me--
EDUARDO goes back out into--
INT. BULLPEN - CONTINUOUS

Mark?

EDUARDO

MARK doesn’t look up from his computer--

149.

Mark.

EDUARDO (CONT’D)

MARK still doesn’t look up--

SEAN
He’s wired in.

EDUARDO

(pause)

I’m sorry?

SEAN
He’s wired in.

Is he?

Yes.

EDUARDO

SEAN

EDUARDO picks up MARK’s laptop over his head and smashes it 
down on the desk, breaking it into pieces.

How ‘bout now, are you still wired in?

EDUARDO

SEAN

(to the girl at the desk he’s 
leaning against)

Call security.

Everyone in the office is frozen, silent and watching.

EDUARDO

You issued over 24-million new shares of 
stock.

MARK

You were told that if new investors came 
along--

EDUARDO

How much were your shares diluted? How 
much were his?!

CUT TO:
INT. FIRST DEPOSITION ROOM - EVENING

GRETCHEN

What was Mr. Zuckerberg’s ownership share 
diluted down to?

It wasn’t.

EDUARDO

GRETCHEN

What was Mr. Moskovitz’s ownership share 
diluted down to?

It wasn’t.

EDUARDO

GRETCHEN

What was Sean Parker’s ownership share 
diluted down to?

It wasn’t.

EDUARDO

What was Peter Thiel’s ownership share

It wasn’t.

What was your ownership share diluted 
down to?

EDUARDO

Point-zero-three percent.

CUT TO:
INT. NEW FACEBOOK OFFICES - NIGHT

You signed the papers.

MARK

EDUARDO

You set me up.
MARK

You’re gonna blame me because you were 
the business head of the company and you 
made a bad business deal with your own 
company?!

EDUARDO

It’s gonna be like I’m not part of 
Facebook.

SEAN

It’s won’t be like you’re not part of 
Facebook, you’re not part of Facebook.

My name’s on the masthead.

EDUARDO

151.

You might wanna check again.

SEAN

EDUARDO is momentarily frozen...

This is because I froze the account?

EDUARDO

SEAN

You think we were gonna let you parade 
around in your ridiculous suits 
pretending you were running this company?

EDUARDO

Sorry, my Prada’s at the cleaners along 
with my hoodie and my fuck-you flip-flops 
you pretentious douchebag.

Security’s here. You’ll be leaving now.

SEAN

Two SECURITY GUARDS have come in--

I’m not signing those papers.

EDUARDO

We’ll get the signature.

SEAN

EDUARDO

(turning to MARK)

Tell me this isn’t about me getting into 
the Phoenix!
(pause)

EDUARDO (CONT’D)

You did it. I always knew you did it. You 
planted the story about the chicken.

SEAN

(pause)

What is he talking about?

You had me accused--

EDUARDO

Seriously, what the hell’s the chicken?

SEAN

EDUARDO

And I’ll bet what you hated the most is 
that they identified me as a co-founder of 
Facebook--which I am! You better lawyer-
up, asshole, ‘cause I’m not comin’ back 
for my 30 percent, I’m comin’ back for 
everything!

152.

SEAN

(to SECURITY)
Get him outa here.
EDUARDO

I’m going.

Hang on.

SEAN

SEAN hands EDUARDO a folded check.
SEAN (CONT’D)

I almost forgot, there’s your $19,000. I 
wouldn’t cash it, though, I drew it on 
the account you froze.

EDUARDO looks at SEAN...then suddenly and quickly cocks his 
fist back to punch him in the face. SEAN flinches as EDUARDO 
holds his punch and lets out a small laugh.

EDUARDO

I like standing next to you, Sean. It 
makes me look so tough.

EDUARDO exits with the security escort.
There’s a long silence in the room...

SEAN

That’s it, that’s our show for tonight, 
people. So I want to see everybody here 
geared up for a party. We’re gonna walk 
down to the club like it’s the Macy’s 
Parade. Mackey, put it up on the big 
screen, we’ve gotta be almost there.

A young employee hits a remote and a few keys on his computer 
and a huge flat-screen displays a Facebook page with a read-
out of the number of members.

999,942

There’s scattered applause and excitement as everyone watches.
SEAN takes MARK aside.

You alright?

SEAN (CONT’D)

MARK

Yeah.
You were kinda rough on him.

(beat)

That’s life in the NFL. 

SEAN

153.

MARK

You know you didn’t have to be that rough 
on him.

Listen, I’m putting together a party--

SEAN

MARK

Sean? You didn’t have to be that rough on 
him.

SEAN

He almost killed it. I’ll send flowers. 
Speaking of flowers, I’m putting together 
a party after the party at Kappa Eta 
Sigma. Ashleigh’s a sister.

MARK
Uh...Ashleigh?
SEAN

The intern.

No, yeah, I know who she is. Are you guys--

MARK

SEAN

Ashleigh? Me? No. A little bit. Oh no, do 
you like her? Dude--

No. No. I was just, no.

MARK

An intern, ASHLEIGH, comes along with a small package--

Excuse me, Mark?

ASHLEIGH

We were just talkin’ about you. 

SEAN

Just that you’re doing a really good job.

MARK

ASHLEIGH

Thanks, I appreciate that.
These came in for you.

(to MARK)

Put them on my desk.

MARK

ASHLEIGH puts the small package on Mark’s desk.

What’s the package?

SEAN

Nothing.

MARK

SEAN

Mackey!

MACKEY

(calling back)

Yes sir!

Refresh!

SEAN

MACKEY hits the “refresh” key and the big screen shows--

CHEERS erupts throughout the place. SEAN grabs MARK and hugs 
him but MARK doesn’t quite hug back...
CUT TO:
EXT. SORORITY HOUSE - NIGHT
We can hear the thumping music coming from the party inside 
and college kids have spilled out onto the front lawn of this 
pristine, four-columned house.
INT. SORORITY HOUSE - NIGHT
It’s dark but we can make out people dancing. The place is 
packed.
CUT TO:
INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
We hear the thumping music from the party. SEAN’s in there 
with a couple of guys, ASHLEIGH and two other girls. SEAN’s 
got his cell phone out and will snap a picture every once in a 
while.

Do it on anything. You can use a CD.

FRATERNITY GUY

You can do it off me.

SORORITY GIRL #2

The girl’s sat on the bed and unbuttoned her top. Her shirt’s 
unbuttoned all the way but we can’t really see anything--just 
the part of her chest that’s being used as a surface off of 
which to snort coke.

Alright!

SORORITY GIRL 

The GIRL taps out some coke from a vial onto the other girl’s 
chest and starts passing around a rolled up 20-dollar bill for 
everyone to have a turn and she herself will unbutton her 
shirt too for the same purpose. All this while SEAN is 
talking.

155.

SEAN

The next transformative development? A 
picture sharing application. A place 
where you view pictures that coincide 
with your social life. It is...the true 
digitalization of real life. You don’t 
just go to a party anymore, you go to a 
party with your digital camera and your 
friends relive the party on Facebook. And 
tagging. The idea--

Would this be easier without the bra?

SORORITY GIRL #2

It’s worth finding out.

FRATERNITY GUY

The girls start happily slipping off their bras--

SEAN

I’ve spent hours watching what people do 
when they log on.

ASHLEIGH

Wait, that’s weird. Why did the music 
stop?

ASHLEIGH has a point. The music stopped in the middle of 
SEAN’s speech and the sound outside from the party just 
doesn’t sound like a party anymore.

SEAN

How they check their friends’ status 
updates, checked to see which of their 
friends had changed their profiles, 
changed their photos and mostly...

Seriously, what happened to the music?

ASHLEIGH

SEAN

We lived on farms and then we lived in 
cities and now we’re gonna live on the 
internet.

ASHLEIGH

Sean. Stop. I think something’s going on 
downstairs.

SEAN stops talking...he senses it too now.
SEAN walks out of the room to the--

156.

INT. STAIRCASE LANDING - CONTINUOUS
And out the window he sees a fleet of police cars with their 
lights flashing parked in front of the house. Then before he 
can react, the front door flies open--
POLICE with flashlights walk in--the beams of light streaking 
across the darkened party floor and the faces.
We HEAR muffled murmurs from the cops of “party’s over” and 
“step to the side” and “nobody’s leaving just yet”, etc.
SEAN bolts back into--
INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
--leaving the door open.
SEAN
It’s the cops.

And they all spring into action. The girls are putting their 
bras back on, SEAN is wiping down a night table with the palm 
of his hand to get the coke dust off.

Shit.

Be cool.

SORORITY GIRL 

FRATERNITY GUY

They turn to see TWO POLICEMEN standing in the doorway, their 
flashlights scanning the room and hitting SEAN’s eyes.

SEAN

Good to see you officer. What can I do 
for you?

What’s goin’ on?

POLICEMAN

SEAN

(beat)

Was the music too loud? We have a 
celebration going.

Miss, I need you to button your blouse.

POLICEMAN

I can have them turn the music down.

SEAN

One of the policemen casually takes SEAN’s hand and sees that 
his palm looks like he just used it to erase a blackboard.

That’s not mine.

SEAN (CONT’D)

157.

POLICEMAN

Okay, we’re gonna need identification. 
Keep your hands where we can see them.

And the handcuffs start to come out and we’ve got a room of 
terrified children.

Oh my God.

SORORITY GIRL 

We start to move in on SEAN...
POLICEMAN

(to SEAN)

You got anything in your pockets I should 
know about?

No sir, no.

SEAN

POLICEMAN
Don’t be stupid now.

I don’t.

SEAN
It’s an Epipen.

Shit.

SEAN

It’s alright, it’s gonna be alright. I’ve 
posted bond and I wasn’t doing anything. 
I mean, I’ve got allergies so I can’t--
We’re back on MARK’s side. He listens...listens...

Interns?

Back on SEAN’s side--

It was just a party.

It’s cool, I’ve got it under control.

I’ll get it under control. I’ll call 
someone and see what the next move is. 
But this is gonna be news now.

SEAN

You don’t think Eduardo was involved do 
you? Do you think--

No.

MARK

SEAN

Or Manningham. One of them. Somebody. 
Somebody sent that coke in their ‘cause 
it got in there. You believe me. This is 
gonna be fine, right?

MARK
Go home, Sean.

MARK clicks the phone shut. He sits there a moment.
He looks at the small package that Ashleigh dropped on his 
desk earlier. He opens up the brown paper wrapping and there’s 
a box. 
He opens the box--a thousand brand new business cards. He 
takes one of the business cards out and looks at it.

We’re done for the day.

MARYLIN (CONT’D)

MARK

Yeah. Yeah. I was just sitting here.

What happened to Sean?

MARYLIN

MARK

He still owns 7% of the company. All you 
had all day was that salad. You want to 
get something to eat?

I can’t.

MARYLIN

MARK

I’m not a bad guy.
MARYLIN

I know that. When’s there’s emotional 
testimony I assume 85% of it is 
exaggeration.

MARK

And the other 15%?
MARYLIN

Perjury. Creation myths need a devil.

MARK 

What happens now?
MARYLIN

Sy and the others are having a steak on 
University Ave. Then they’ll come back up 
to the office and start working on a 
settlement agreement to present to you.

They’re gonna settle?

MARK

161.

MARYLIN

Oh yeah. And you’re gonna have to pay a 
little extra.

Why?

MARK

MARYLIN

So that these guys sign a non-disclosure 
agreement. They say one unflattering word 
about you in public and you own their 
wife and kids.
MARK

I invented Facebook.

MARYLIN

I’m talking about a jury. I  specialize 
in voir dire--jury selection. And what 
the jury sees when they look at the 
defendant. Clothes, hair, speaking style, 
likability--

Likability?

MARK

MARYLIN

I’ve been licensed to practice law for 
all of 20 months and I could get a jury 
to believe you planted the story about 
Eduardo and the chicken. Watch what else. 
Why weren’t you at Sean’s sorority party 
that night?

MARK

You think I’m the one who called the 
police?

MARYLIN

Doesn’t matter. I asked the question and 
now everybody’s thinking about it. You’ve 
lost your jury in the first 10 minutes.

Farm animals?

Yeah.

MARYLIN

I was drunk and angry and stupid.

You’re not an asshole, Mark. You’re just 
trying so hard to be.

MARYLIN, who’s been putting on her coat, takes her briefcase 
and exits.
MARK sits down at the computer. He logs on to Facebook. 
He types a name in the search box: “Erica Albright”.
Erica’s name and picture come up, along with Boston 
University, ‘07. Mark smiles. She’s on Facebook.
He moves the mouse back and forth between two boxes: “Send a 
Message” and “Add as a Friend”.
He clicks on “Add as a Friend”.
A box comes up that reads: “Your request to add Erica Albright 
as a friend has been sent.”
Then MARK clicks to his homepage and waits for the response.
And waits...then hits “Refresh”.
