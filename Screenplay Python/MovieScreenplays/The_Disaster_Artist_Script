To say it’s a “bad” movie is offensive to

The sex scenes are particularly

This is something else, something...

If I had a time machine, I would love to

AND WE CUT TO:

TITLES: “The Disaster Artist”

INT JEAN SHELTON’S ACTING STUDIO
TWO ACTORS are performing a scene on a small stage. One 
of them is GREG SESTERO (19, blonde, California surfer 
dude handsome).
SUPER: San Francisco, July 1998

“Unless Godot comes.”

MALE ACTING STUDENT

GREG
“And if he comes?”

“We’ll be saved.”

MALE ACTING STUDENT

Greg slowly takes off his hat. Looks at it. He’s “ACTING” 
but not very confidently. 

“Well. Shall we go?”

GREG

Greg’s performance is painfully flat. You’ve never seen a 
more self-conscious actor. 

“Pull on your trousers.”

MALE ACTING STUDENT

“What?”

GREG

“Pull on your trousers.”

MALE ACTING STUDENT

“You want me to pull off my trousers?”

GREG

A VOICE from the beyond calls:

STOP! Stop! Jesus. That was...

JEAN SHELTON (O.S.)

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 3

The voice belongs to legendary acting teacher JEAN 
SHELTON (60s, small in stature, huge in every other way) 
in the front row of the acting school.

JEAN SHELTON
Painfully unremarkable. 

We see Greg visibly deflate. This hurts. 

JEAN SHELTON

Rob, your breath control is all over the 
place. And Greg... 

Greg waits for it. 

JEAN SHELTON

So scared and insecure. Like a wounded 
puppy. 

Greg sighs. Knows she’s right.

Do you even want to be an actor?

JEAN SHELTER

More than anything.

GREG

Jean just sighs, shakes her head. Greg and his Scene 
Partner take their seats, Jean turns to the rest of the 
class...

JEAN SHELTON

Who else? Who can show me they WANT this? 
Anyone?

No takers. The room too afraid of her wrath at the 
moment. And then:

I go.

VOICE FROM THE BACK

The whole room turns to the VOICE. 
It belongs to a long-haired, muscle-toned, serious 
looking MAN with a slight hunch and a creased face. He 
wears black pants, a gaudy belt, dark sunglasses - equal 
parts “Jack Sparrow” and “1980s Van Damme villain.” 
For the first time, Greg is laying eyes on the man who 
will change his life forever. This is TOMMY WISEAU.
Everyone watches as Tommy saunters slowly up to the 
stage. 
Focused, intense, he turns a chair around and straddles 
it, getting into character. 

And what is it you have for us Thomas?

JEAN SHELTON

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 4

He looks up from the chair, pushing his dyed black locks 
from his face. 

TOMMY

It is Tommy. Not Thomas. 
Never Thomas.

(beat, serious)

Shelton rolls her eyes. Whatever. She sits. 

When you’re ready...

JEAN SHELTON

Greg, too, sits back, intrigued, as if knowing he’s about 
to witness something unforgettable. 
The man called Tommy looks up at the ceiling, channeling, 
well, something. After a few beats, he begins.

Stella... Stella...?  

TOMMY

Tommy’s accent is every bit as unusual as his fashion 
sense. French, German, Eastern European - impossible to 
tell. Tommy says “Stella” a few more times. Then he 
stands. Starts wandering the stage like a lost kitten. 

TOMMY

(louder)

STELLA!

Maybe Tommy hasn’t read the rest of the play. Or maybe he 
doesn’t speak English. Anything is possible right now. 
Greg sees some of his fellow students looking at one 
another, trying to make sense of what they’re seeing. 
Tommy doesn’t seem to notice or care.

STELLLLLAAAA!!!!!!!!!!

TOMMY

Tommy shouts it at the crowd. Then he shouts it at the 
floor. That he shouts it at the chair. He kicks the 
chair, causing even Jean (who’s seen everything) to jump 
in her seat. Everyone is aghast.
And finally, at long last, he collapses, covering his 
face with his hands. He starts to rock back and forth, as 
if experiencing an epileptic fit.
Greg is amazed. The balls on this guy. 

TOMMY

(one last shriek)
STELLA!!!!
(and then, quietly)
Don’t ever leave me baby.

He lays on the ground another long beat. Then it’s over. 

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 5

Tommy stands, runs his fingers through his hair, waits 
for Jean Shelton’s response. (Everyone is waiting for 
Jean Shelton’s response.) 

Where to begin...

JEAN SHELTON

Someone in the crowd laughs, nervously. Jean puts her 
hand up to silence that person. 

JEAN SHELTON

I’ll ask you this, Tommy. What was it you 
were trying to accomplish with that?

Tommy doesn’t understand the question. 

I was performing the Tennessee Williams.

TOMMY

JEAN SHELTON

Yes but... what is your objective? What 
does Stanley want?
TOMMY

He is... hysterical.

JEAN SHELTON

No, see, that is not an objective. 
Objective means pursuit. You’re pursuing 
someone, trying to reach them. You’re not 
screaming because you’re sick or in pain -
-

Forgive me, but you’re wrong.

TOMMY

And that takes the whole room by surprise. Jean’s eyes go 
wide. No one has ever spoken to her in this way. She 
can’t believe it. In fact, no one can believe it.

TOMMY

See, I know this Stanley.
(resets the chair)
I show you again --

Jean raises her hand.

I’ve seen enough, thank you. 

JEAN SHELTON

Tommy shrugs, walks back to his seat. To Jean, as he 
passes:

You don’t know the Stanley. 

TOMMY

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 6

Jean doesn’t know what to make of this person. Tommy 
keeps walking, passing Greg as he does. Greg looks up at 
him - awed. How can anyone have that confidence? And we 

CUT TO:

EXT JEAN SHELTON’S ACTING STUDIO - MOMENTS LATER
Tommy beating a hasty retreat. Greg races up to him. 

Excuse me.
Tommy keeps walking. 

Hey man.

GREG

GREG

It’s only this second attempt that Tommy realizes someone 
is talking to him. 

My name’s Greg. Greg Sestero. 

GREG

Tommy looks Greg up and down. Who is this guy? 

Would you want to do a scene together?

GREG

And on Tommy’s face, CUT TO:

EXT GREG’S SAN FRANCISCO HOME - DAY
Greg is having a FOOTBALL CATCH with a NEIGHBOR KID when 
a white Mercedes, its windows tinted, pulls up. The 
windows come down. Sure enough:  

Get in.

TOMMY

Tommy is dressed in an elegant white shirt and tight 
black skinny jeans. 

Oh. I thought we were --

GREG

TOMMY

I have to eat now. I get cranky little 
bit when I don’t eat.

Greg hesitates. This is already super weird. Tommy 
misreads.

TOMMY
Don’t worry, I pay.

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 7

Greg thinks about it. Shrugs. Why not? Hops in the front. 
He looks at the car’s interior. Brand new, all the 
amenities. He wasn’t expecting this.

Nice car.

GREG

Tommy turns to him, intense.
TOMMY

Don't talk about me.

What?

GREG

TOMMY

What I drive. Where I go. You understand, 
yes?

Greg does not. At all. But he doesn’t say so. He sees a 
toy ROBOT CRAB wiggling on the dashboard.

And don’t look at robot crab. He’s shy. 

TOMMY

And with that, the car pulls out and off they go. CUT TO:

INT LITTLE TONI’S - LATER
Packed at lunchtime. Tommy and Greg in a booth. Tommy 
still has his sunglasses on. He flags a PERSON walking by 
(who definitely isn't a waiter).

I need to order.

TOMMY

I don't work here.

CONFUSED PERSON

Guy walks on. Soon enough the WAITER appears. Before he 
can even speak:

TOMMY

Pesto pasta, minestrone soup, and a cup 
of hot water.

Sorry, did you say “hot water?”

WAITER

TOMMY

Why you give me hard time? Hot water, 
yes. And more bread with raisin stuff. 

The Waiter looks at Greg, wondering if he’s equally as 
odd.

Just... coffee for me, thanks.

GREG

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 8

The Waiter leaves. 

Why you ask me here?

TOMMY

What?

GREG

Scene partners. You making joke?

TOMMY

No. I... 

GREG

Greg tries to think of the right thing to say.

GREG

Look, the thing is... when I get up 
there, in front of people, all I can 
think about is, “what if they laugh at 
me, what if I embarrass myself.” I’m not 
in the moment. But you... I mean, shit 
man, you’re amazing!

Tommy sits back, listening.
GREG

I figured I could learn a thing or two, 
that’s all. 

Tommy considers this. For a moment, we’re not sure if he 
buys it. Then he takes out 2 copies of “The Lightning Rod 
Man” by Melville. 

Let’s do scene.

TOMMY

You mean here? 

GREG

Greg is obviously intimidated by the crowd. Not Tommy. 

So what? Yes. 

TOMMY

There’s like... people trying to eat --

GREG

TOMMY

Are you not dedicated actor? To be 
dedicated, you have to rehearse.

Greg looks around at all the crowded DINERS. 

TOMMY

I will play “The Lightning Rod Man.” You 
play... this other man. With a Z.

Zechariah. Ok.

GREG

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 9

TOMMY

(beat, reads)

Ok.
“Good day, sir.”
GREG

(quiet, embarrassed)

“Good day.”

Louder.

What?

TOMMY

GREG

TOMMY

Louder. Really project yourself. “GOOD 
DAY, SIR!”

This draws the attention of some PATRONS. Greg turns to 
them, self-conscious.

TOMMY

Forget them. There is only you and there 
is only me. “I said, GOOD DAY SIR!” 

Greg is a little hesitant but he takes a deep breath. And 
he goes for it.

GREG

(reads)

“Have I, sir, the honor of a visit from 
that illustrious god, Jupiter Tonans?” 

Greg looks up. What the fuck is this play?

That’s good, keep going...

TOMMY

GREG

(getting more into it)
“So stood he in the Greek statue of old, 
grasping the lightning-bolt.”

Tommy nods, encouraging.

GREG

“If you be he, or his viceroy, I have to 
thank YOU - for this noble storm...”

Hey, it’s actually working for Greg. And we CUT TO:

EXT LITTLE TONI’S - LATER
Greg and Tommy emerge. Greg feels great! 

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 10

GREG

It’s like Brando says. “You have to feel 
every performance right in your bones. 
That’s how you know it’s right.”

TOMMY
Bridgitte Brando?
GREG

No. Marlon Brando. 
The Godfather? On the Waterfront? 

(Tommy has no idea)

Nothing.

GREG

He did that “Stella” speech in the 
“Streetcar” movie. 
TOMMY

Ah yes. I like this guy.

Greg looks at Tommy askew. Then he smiles.

GREG

Oh man, I’m gonna show you some things 
that will blow your mind!

Tommy nods. A nice beat. Greg assumes the day is done.

So I'll see you in class?

GREG

You brought football, no? Let's play.

TOMMY

In that?

GREG

Tommy smiles wide and runs into the park. Greg shakes his 
head. Nothing to do but follow. CUT TO:

EXT POLO FIELDS AT GOLDEN GATE PARK - LATER
Greg throws Tommy the ball. He bobbles and drops it.

TOMMY

My God, sun shine like hell today. This 
park is no place for vampire.

GREG

(weirded out)

What?

TOMMY

(changing the subject)
You ever been to Los Angeles?

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 11

Tommy picks up the ball and throws it back to Greg - a 
wobbly sideways pass that never comes close to reaching 
him.

GREG

Once. When I was little. Universal 
Studios. Graumin’s Chinese. Sunset 
Boulevard. 
Best two days of my life. 

(beat)

TOMMY

In Los Angeles, everyone want to be star. 
All these pretty boys waiting for their 
chance...

Greg throws the ball back. Again Tommy drops it.

Just have to get lucky, I guess.

GREG

And that angers Tommy. 

No!

TOMMY

He gets in his face. Greg has no idea what’s happening.

You have to be the best. 

TOMMY

Greg nods, ok. And then Tommy drop kicks the football, 
sending it flying over Greg’s head. 

Touchdown!

TOMMY

Greg laughs. Tommy does too. Enjoying themselves. 
CUT TO:

INT THIRD FLOOR HALLWAY - GUERRERO STREET CONDO - SAME
They approach the entrance to Tommy’s condo. Tommy takes 
out a KEY RING with at least fifty keys on it. As he’s 
about to open the door, he stops.

TOMMY

I must ask you again. Please don’t talk 
about me. Not to class. Not to anyone.

Greg nods. After a stern beat, Tommy accepts this. Opens 
the door. Greg follows him inside, no idea what to 
expect. 

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 12

INT TOMMY’S CONDO - GUERRERO STREET - SAME
And it’s weird. PAPERS strewn everywhere, BOXES spilling 
over with CASSETTE TAPES (each one labeled with a 
different date), VIDEOTAPES, OFFICE EQUIPMENT, a BLUE 
UNICORN statue in the corner next to a random SHOPPING 
CART filled with empty PLASTIC BAGS.

The maid’s on vacation. 

TOMMY

Cool, cool...

GREG

That explains it. Tommy walks into another room, leaving 
Greg to continue exploring. On one wall are several 
framed PORTRAITS OF TOMMY, on another is the AMERICAN 
FLAG. In fact, there are American Flags all over.

GREG

So where you from, Tommy?
TOMMY (O.S.)

New Orleans.

Originally?

GREG

No response. Greg keeps exploring:
On one shelf are hand-crafted SCULPTURES of DISNEY 
CHARACTERS, a SKELETOR MASK, and a vase of DEAD ROSES. On 
another, BOOKS about acting and film. Greg sees a framed 
poem, perhaps Tommy’s favorite, called “I Do Not Choose 
to Be a Common Man.” 
Greg sees a bunch of shopping bags scattered around the 
room, all with a particular amateurish label on it. 
“Street Fashions USA.”
Tommy re-enters with two glasses of water. 

“Street Fashions USA?”

GREG

TOMMY

I do marketing, you know, retail stuff. 
I am man of many skills. 

(off Greg’s surprise)

Greg is impressed. And now Greg’s eyes fall on a 
PHOTOGRAPH of a much younger Tommy standing in front of 
the Eiffel Tower. It looks to be taken in the 1960s.

When was this taken?

GREG

Few years back.

TOMMY

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 13

Wow, you look so young in it.

GREG

I’m not so old now, you know.

TOMMY

GREG
How old are you?

Don’t be smart guy ok?

TOMMY

A beat. Greg quickly changes the subject. 

So... how’d you get into acting?

GREG

TOMMY

It’s always been dream. Long time. But I 
ignore it. And then, one day, I have 
accident. Guy runs red light and SMASH! 
Very bad. Like wake up call you could 
say. So I stop the other things, go back 
to my dream.  
Greg nods, understanding.

GREG

For me, everything changed with “Home 
Alone.”

“Home Alone?” What is that? Movie?

TOMMY

Yeah, it’s... “Home Alone?” 

GREG

Tommy has apparently never heard of it. 

GREG

Anyway, it spoke to me, man. That movie 
changed my life. Ever since then, I... 

You want to be star.

TOMMY

GREG

I just want to be in movies. It’s what I 
was born to do.

TOMMY

I understand. 
It’s your dream...

(beat)

Greg nods. Finally someone who understands him. One day 
with Tommy and he can feel his confidence growing. 

CUT TO:

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 14

A MOVIE SCENE FROM “REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE.” 
JAMES DEAN as Jim Stark. He’s in the holding cell at the 
precinct and his parents have come to bail him out. 

“Don’t I buy you every thing you want?”

JIM BACKUS

“Oh you buy me many things...”

JAMES DEAN

JIM BACKUS

“We give you love and affection don’t we? 
Then what is it?!”

REVEAL we are:

INT TOMMY’S APARTMENT- ANOTHER NIGHT
Greg is showing Tommy “Rebel Without a Cause.” Tommy 
watches with rapt attention. 
BACK ON TV SCREEN, Dean’s Parents continue to argue with 
one another, until finally, Dean just can’t take it any 
more:

JAMES DEAN

(shouting)

“YOU’RE TEARING ME APART!”

Tommy slaps Greg on the arm - you see that?! Greg smiles. 
Tommy, enraptured, leans forward in his chair, studying 
every inflection and mannerism of Dean’s performance. His 
idol.

INT LITTLE TONI’S - LATER THAT NIGHT
Tommy and Greg are buzzing from the brilliance of the 
film.

TOMMY

He is emotion! Moment to moment. Not 
plastic. 

I thought you would like that. 

GREG

TOMMY

The way he speaks. Style. He has that 
signature thing.
GREG

Yeah it’s called being James Dean.

You can be like Dean.

TOMMY

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 15

Me?

GREG

TOMMY

My God you are behind the schedule! 
Listen to me, young man... you have the 
gift, you have the look. Now you watch 
the Dean. Very close. And you learn. 

Greg takes that in.

You really believe that?

GREG

TOMMY
I believe in you. 

Greg is amazed at this. Tommy sees Greg as he wants to be 
seen. As no one else sees him. It’s a powerful thing. 

GREG

I believe in you too, Tommy. If I can 
have a career in this business, so can 
you --

I don’t want career. 

TOMMY

GREG
Oh. I thought --

I want my own planet.

TOMMY

GREG
“Your own planet?”
TOMMY

Call it Tommy’s planet. Big lights, big 
stores, big events... spectacular. 

Again, Greg wants to laugh at this but he can’t. Tommy’s 
enthusiasm - his unbridled confidence - is overpowering. 

TOMMY

And you can live there too if you want. I 
let you stay for a while. 

Thanks. 

GREG

Greg laughs at this. Tommy smiles. Holds Greg’s gaze a 
beat. 

Here. I have present.

TOMMY

Tommy takes something out of his pocket. It’s a PEN with 
the Street Fashions USA label. Tommy hands it to Greg 
with great drama and meaning. 

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 16

Greg takes it. He looks at the other side of the label 
and on it is the picture of an ORB. Written beneath the 
orb, “Tommy’s Planet.” On Greg’s bewildered face, CUT TO:

EXT DINER - LATER
Greg and Tommy exit, back to talking about Dean and the 
film. 

GREG

... three movies and just like that he’s 
dead. What a tragedy. 

Tommy nods in agreement. 

GREG

(beat)

You know he died in Cholame, south of 
here. 
I want to go one day. To the crash site. 
Pay my respects -- 
TOMMY

So let’s do it.

What, now? It’s like 300 miles away...

GREG

Tommy throws him his keys.

You drive. 

TOMMY

And just like that, Greg and Tommy are taking a road 
trip. 

INT TOMMY'S CAR - LATER
Greg drives. He's mid-story...

GREG

... we had this talent show in middle 
school and I was gonna sing it.

In front of everyone?

TOMMY

GREG

The whole school - parents, teachers, 
everybody. I was so excited. Learned all 
the words, practiced day and night --

So you could win the contest?

TOMMY

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 17

GREG

No. I was just excited to do it. My first 
chance to perform in front of an 
audience, you know. It was a pretty big 
deal.

Yeah, yeah, I get the picture...

TOMMY

GREG

So the day before the show I’m in my 
room, I take a break from singing to go 
down, get some orange juice. And as I’m 
walking down I hear my parents. They must 
have thought I was still upstairs...

Greg recalls the painful memory. Tommy sees his face 
change. 

TOMMY
What did they say?
GREG

My Dad was all, “who told that kid he 
could sing? He sounds terrible. He’s 
gonna embarrass us in front of our 
friends.” 

Tommy absorbs that. Wow.

GREG

And my Mom, who usually stuck up for 
me...
All she could say was “when he realizes 
he’s terrible... maybe then he’ll grow 
out of this shit.”

(shakes his head)

Greg stares straight ahead, remembering. It hurts him 
still.

GREG

Next morning, they woke me up. 
I faked a stomach flu. Stayed home for 
the day.

(beat)

You missed the whole show?

TOMMY

Greg keeps driving. 

GREG
To this day I’ve never had the guts to 
sing in public...

A long beat of silence. Greg continues to drive. 
Eventually:

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 18

My god, Greg, what a story.

TOMMY

They drive in silence a few beats. And then:

“Aruba. Jamaica. Ooh I wanna take ya.” 

TOMMY

Tommy gestures it’s Greg’s turn. Greg laughs. But then 
sees Tommy is dead serious.
GREG

No.

“Bermuda. Bahama. Come on pretty mama...”

TOMMY

A beat. Tommy looks at Greg. Won’t take no for an answer. 
Greg rolls his eyes.

“Key Largo. Montego...”

TOMMY

Until finally Greg, with a smile, joins in. 

TOMMY/GREG

“Baaaay be why don’t we go down to 
Kokomo. 

Greg appreciates what Tommy wants to do for him.

TOMMY/GREG

“We’ll take it fast and then we’ll take 
it slow...”

Tommy stops singing to allow Greg to finish alone.

“That’s where we wanna go...”

GREG

“Way down in Kokomo!”

TOMMY/GREG

And on the two of them belting it out unabashed, CUT TO:

EXT HIGHWAY 46 - LATER
Somber. The car is parked by the side of the road. Its 
headlights on, illuminating the spot where James Dean 
died. 

I will miss him. Very much. 

TOMMY

Greg nods. In the moment. 

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 19

GREG

His whole life he hears “you’re not good 
enough, you’ll never make it - but he 
doesn’t listen. 

And he shows them all...

TOMMY

Greg nods.

That will be us, Greg.

TOMMY

Greg laughs. Then sees Tommy is serious. 

We will show them all. You’ll see.

TOMMY

He becomes serious too. 

TOMMY
Gimme your pinky.
GREG

What?

Pinky swear... 
Tommy holds out his PINKY.

TOMMY

TOMMY

Right here, right now. We make a pact. To 
push each other. Believe in each other. 
To never lose sight of our dream. 

Greg nods, he’s fired up. He locks his pinky with 
Tommy’s. It’s a deal. CUT TO:

INT TOMMY’S CAR - LATER
LATER. Drive back, still awash in the euphoria of their 
pact.

We should move to LA.

TOMMY

Yeah right. 

Why not? 

GREG

TOMMY

GREG

(shoots him a look)

Tommy, I can’t just go to LA. 

Sure you can. Why can’t you?

TOMMY

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 20

For one thing, I can’t afford it.

GREG

This not a problem. We stay at my place.

TOMMY

Wait, you have a place in LA?

GREG

TOMMY

I have apartment that I rarely use. We 
can go there together. 
Roommates. Hahaha.

(beat)

Greg can’t believe it.

Are you being serious right now?

GREG

Hey it’s up to you. I don’t force you. 

TOMMY

Greg is speechless. But very intrigued.

TOMMY

You ever have roommate before? 
You’ll love it. Roommates the best.

(he shakes his head)

Greg is deep in thought but he can’t help but smile, his 
dream in reach. Tommy sees it.

TOMMY

I see you smiling babyface. This could be 
great, no? The start of something very 
special. 

And we hear:

ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?!

MRS. SESTERO (OVERLAP)

INT SESTERO HOUSE - DAY
Greg is lugging suitcases towards the front door. His MOM 
(50s, French, overworked) isn’t helping. 

MRS. SESTERO

You can’t just pack up and move to LA. 
It’s absurd. What are you gonna do for 
money? 

GREG

I have money saved from the modeling 
jobs. 

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 21

MRS. SESTERO

That money will last you two weeks. Then 
what?

GREG

I’ll... get a job or... I don’t know, 
I’ll figure it out! 

MRS. SESTERO

And this “Tommy” person... You barely 
know this man and you’re moving in 
together.

We’re not moving in together. 

GREG

MRS. SESTERO
What does he want with you, hmm? Nothing 
in life is for free Greg.

GREG

It’s... I’m just gonna stay at his place 
for a while... 

She shakes her head.

MRS. SESTERO

Do you know how hard it is? This acting 
thing?  You don’t just move to LA and 
things happen. You have to be lucky. You 
have to be talented...

Greg shoots her a look.

You know what I mean. 

MRS. SESTERO

A beat.

MRS. SESTERO

I’ve tried so hard to protect you. You 
walk out that door...

I know what I’m doing, ok, Mom.

GREG

Mrs. Sestero does not seem convinced. At which point, we 
hear a HORN from outside. Greg looks through the window 
to see Tommy pull up in his convertible. Greg smiles. 
Mrs. Sestero gets her first good look at Tommy. Her eyes 
open wide. CUT TO: 

EXT SESTERO HOUSE - SAME
Greg makes his way towards the car lugging a SUITCASE.
SUPER: August 31, 1998

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 22

He throws one in the back. Goes back to get another. From 
behind him comes Mrs. Sestero.

So you must be Tommy...

MRS. SESTERO

I am Tommy.

TOMMY

She holds his gaze a beat.

MRS. SESTERO

I need to ask you something Tommy because 
I’m looking at your eyes and they’re 
completely red. Are you on drugs?

Drugs? Ha ha ha.

TOMMY

Greg comes back out with another suitcase.

MRS. SESTERO

Perhaps you can tell me why you wish to 
help my son?

TOMMY

Why, what is problem? Babyface is cool 
guy. 

MRS. SESTERO

(to Greg)

Babyface??

Greg shakes his head. Wishing Tommy didn’t say that. Mrs. 
Sestero turns back to Tommy. 

MRS. SESTERO

One more thing, Tommy, and this is 
important. 
No sex. Do you hear me?

(beat)

Mom, Jesus!

GREG

Are we clear, Tommy?

MRS. SESTERO

A beat. And then a smile comes over Tommy’s face.

TOMMY
Well, we all do...

And even Greg is weirded out by that.

Wait, what?

GREG

Tommy ignores this, looks at his watch.

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 23

Greg, we really gotta go.

TOMMY

Mom looks at Greg. Greg kisses her on the cheek - he’s 
going. Tears form in her eyes. 
Greg takes a moment to glance back at his window where 
his FATHER is watching him leave. He’s not coming out to 
the car. An unspoken beat. Greg throws his last bag in 
the back. Hops in. 

Be safe, Mon Cherie.

MRS. SESTERO

Tommy puts the car into gear, perhaps forgetting he’s in 
a convertible, he says to Greg:

My god, she’s crazy!

TOMMY

What does that mean, “We all do?!”

GREG

TOMMY
Figure of speech. 

Greg lets that go. He takes one last look back at the 
window where his father was and isn’t anymore. He’s 
hoping he’s doing the right thing and truly believes that 
he is. Time will tell. And we CUT TO:

EXT 405 HIGHWAY - LATER
A bird’s eye view of the car driving South. 

INT TOMMY’S CAR - SAME
The guys in mid-conversation. 

TOMMY

... not just vampire movie. All time 
greatest vampire movie. I call it 
“Vampire From Alcatraz: King of 
Vampires.” 

Wow.

GREG

You would see this movie? 

TOMMY

GREG

Fuck yeah I would. 
TOMMY

Of course you would. It would be 
unforgettable movie. Based on truth. 

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 24

Wait, what do you mean “truth?”

GREG

Greg looks at Tommy, unsure if he’s serious. Tommy 
smiles. Greg shakes his head - what a joker. Tommy 
points. 

See, we’re almost there. 

TOMMY

Greg looks out the window. Los Angeles is getting closer. 
His excitement builds. CUT TO:

INT TOMMY'S CAR - SAME
Driving through Hollywood.

TOMMY

Coming to LA is not easy, my friend. But 
you take your time, you are only 16 now -

16? Yeah, no, I'm almost 21 --

GREG

Eh, it’s all the same.

TOMMY

Greg isn’t sure what that means. They pass Graumin’s 
Chinese Theatre where a PREMIERE is taking place: “RUSH 
HOUR” with Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker. The red carpet, 
flashbulbs popping. Both men inches from their dream.

GREG
It’s beautiful...

EXT FOUNTAIN AND SUNSET - HOLLYWOOD, CA - LATER
Tommy drives slowly down the street, talking to himself.

TOMMY

Is it this one? Wait, no, it must be... I 
think this is wrong street.

Tommy takes a left. They continue driving, looking for 
the place. Greg finds it very strange that Tommy can’t 
find his own apartment. He keeps that to himself. 

TOMMY
Ah yes. Here it is!

They pull into the entrance to apartment complex.

If anyone ask you are my cousin.

TOMMY

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 25

GREG

Cool.
Wait, why?

(beat)

INT TOMMY'S LOS ANGELES APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
A nice apartment. Not much furniture. The only decoration 
a Doors poster. Still, Greg is impressed. 

Whoa...

GREG

It's not castle but I think it’s ok.

TOMMY

Are you kidding, it’s...

GREG

But then Greg notices there's only 1 bedroom. He is 
suddenly very unsure about this situation.

GREG
...a one bedroom?

Tommy sees Greg’s face.

TOMMY

What’s problem? You don’t want to share a 
bed with me?

A very long beat. Greg looks like he might shit himself.
Then, Tommy smiles...

C’mon, I’m joking. What do you think?

TOMMY

Greg laughs. Phew! 

TOMMY
Check this out... 

Tommy shows Greg a strange portion of the room has been 
partitioned off with BLACK VELVET DRAPES. 

What is it?

GREG

Second bedroom!

TOMMY

Greg looks to get a closer look. A red lamp. An air 
mattress on the floor. Not very homey.

You can have the big bedroom. 

TOMMY

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 26

GREG

Are you sure? Tommy, I can... I can try 
to find a cheap room somewhere... 

TOMMY

No, Greg. I want you to be my guest. Like 
in Beauty and the Beast. 
I’m beauty of course. 

(beat, smiles)

They both laugh.

TOMMY
You’re the beast. 
GREG

Ok.

Greg throws his bag down on the bed.

GREG

Man, you’ve had this place this whole 
time...? 

TOMMY
Several years now.
GREG

How come you never moved down here 
yourself? Made a real go of it or 
something, you know?

Tommy takes a moment to think about this. 

I never had a friend to do it with.

TOMMY

Greg takes that in. A nice beat between them. Tommy 
smiles.

Wait, now I show you best part!

TOMMY

And Tommy runs out of the apartment, excited. Greg, 
smiling, follows after him. 

CUT TO:

EXT ROOFDECK - TOMMY’S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER
The city lights twinkling at night. A stunning view. 

GREG
It’s incredible.

They look out together for a beat. 

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 27

GREG

Tommy... thank you. 
I never would have done any of this if it 
wasn’t for you. 

(beat)

You’re very welcome. 

TOMMY

They turn back to the city lights down below. On top of 
the world. 

GREG
Holy shit, we’re doing this! We’re really 
doing it! Woohoo!
TOMMY

Ha ha ha!

And on that note of unbridled optimism and excitement, 
we, CUT TO:

INT HOLLYWOOD APARTMENT - THE NEXT MORNING
Greg awakens. The bedroom door is open and it seems like 
Tommy’s been gone a long time. Greg picks up an old copy 
of Hollywood Reporter. He blows dust off the cover, opens 
it, and we CUT TO:
SERIES OF SHOTS - Those First Days in LA.
- Greg and Tommy (separately) driving down the stunning 
tree lined streets of Beverly Hills. Expensive-looking 
cars in expensive-looking driveways of even more 
expensive-looking homes. Both of them smiling wide, 
optimistic.
- They both drop head shots off at various agencies. 
- Greg eats a burrito in Poquito Mas. At the next table, 
another ASPIRING ACTOR is circling the trades. Greg 
observes, makes a mental note of this. 
- Tommy at an open casting call. 

Do I hear an accent?

CASTING DIRECTOR 

What? What you mean?

TOMMY

CUT TO:

INT IRIS BURTON AGENCY - LATER
Greg sits across from CHRIS (30, executive assistant). 
Chris is studying Greg’s headshots. 

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 28

As he does, Greg’s eyes look at the client photos on the 
walls: Jerry O'Connell, Hillary Duff, Josh Hartnett. He’s 
sufficiently impressed.

These are great, actually. 

CHRIS

Greg wasn’t expecting that. His eyes light up.

Do you have any tape?

CHRIS

And he deflates.

CHRIS

It’s ok. Not everyone does in the 
beginning. 

Greg smiles, relieved. Chris hits the intercom button.

CHRIS

Can you have Iris come back here a 
moment?

Greg is over the moon. They wait a beat. And then she's 
there, IRIS BURTON (60s, legit). She looks at Greg, 
eyeing him up and down, silently judging.

IRIS

(beat)

Miramax would fellate this guy.

Paramount too.

CHRIS

Greg can’t believe how well this is going.

IRIS

You’re not meeting with anyone else, are 
you? 
Don’t. You’re all mine. 

(before he can answer)

With one last intense look at Greg, Iris Burton marches 
out. Greg looks from her back to Chris. And Chris just 
says:

Welcome to the Iris Burton agency.

CHRIS

Greg can’t believe it!

CUT TO:

What do you mean?
TOMMY

star like you.

(laughs)

GREG
Big star. Tommy --
TOMMY

But you’re on your way. 

Greg thinks about that. It’s true...

I could learn from you. Teach me.

TOMMY

Tommy looks at him, all ears. Greg thinks about it. 

GREG
OK, so, first off:

CUT TO:

INT PHOTOGRAPHY STUDIO - DAY
High end. Fashionable. Expensive. And here’s Tommy posing 
for the CAMERA, his shirt unbuttoned, his lips puckered, 
his hair blowing in the breeze.

GREG (V.O.)

You’re gonna need some headshots. Good 
ones. With lots of poses to show your 
range.

I need more wind machine. 

TOMMY

CUT TO:

EXT STREET - ANOTHER DAY
Tommy looking through the ridiculous HEADSHOTS. In one, 
his shirt is unbuttoned, showing his bare chest, his hair 
is pinned back. He looks like a SCARY WOMAN.
In another, Tommy’s hair is free-flowing and he’s making 
a come hither look at the camera. Blue steel. Tommy is 
pleased.

Greg blinks twice but doesn’t answer.

CUT TO:

Tommy shakes his head. That is fucked up!

GREG

Eventually you book enough gigs to get 
your SAG card. 

SAG card. What is the SAG?

TOMMY

It’s the Actor’s Union. 

GREG

How do I get into Union?

TOMMY

GREG

You can get in through a TV show, 
commercials...

TOMMY

And once I have my SAG card, I am true 
actor?

Yup. 

GREG

Greg notices a PAIR of BEAUTIFUL WOMEN looking over at 
them. He smiles, looks away. Tommy catches it. Sees what 
Greg is looking at. Frowns. Before he can say anything 
the Women have walked over.

WOMAN #1

(smiling at Greg)

We just wanted to come over and say hey.

GREG

(smiling back)

Hey. I'm Greg, this is Tommy.

Tommy glowers.

TOMMY

Ladies, do you mind, we're having a 
conversation. What do you have to offer?

The Women are momentarily stunned.

TOMMY

I ask what you do - something besides 
drink? Any job or anything?
(turns to Woman #2)
You - what do you offer besides taking 
the vodka?

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 32

The Women look at each other - is this guy for real?

WOMAN #2

Have a nice night.
Losers.

(under her breath)

The Women walk away. Greg winces in embarrassment.

Can you believe that?

TOMMY

Greg look at Tommy. No words.
LATER. Tommy on the dance floor - dancing his heart out, 
oblivious to how people are avoiding him. Greg sits alone 
in the booth as the WAITRESS comes by with more drinks.

Vodka soda. And two hot waters...

WAITRESS

Thanks.

GREG

Tommy tries to wave Greg over to dance with him. Greg 
ignores him. Turns back to the Waitress. 

Your friend is... unique.

WAITRESS

That’s for sure.
The Waitress takes a beat.

GREG 

Hey do I know you from somewhere?

WAITRESS

GREG
I... Wow. Really. 
Yeah I mean... I’m an actor.

You’re always at that Poquito Mas off 
Sunset.

Maybe next time, you should come say 
hello.

Or you could just call me. My name’s 
Amber. 

Greg.

ANGLE ON Tommy, dancing his heart out. He sees the 
Waitress lean over and give Greg her phone number. This 
bothers him for some reason. And on his face, CUT TO:

And seeing Amber, he’s doubly annoyed.

GREG

Hey man! This is Amber I was telling you 
about -- 

TOMMY

I don’t have time for this. I must change 
quickly and go.

Oh, ok. Is everything alright?

GREG

You’ve heard of Konstantin Stanislavsky?

GREG

Yeah of course. That’s Olivier’s teacher, 
right?

Impossible. I just speak to him.

beater and a red bandana. Finally, he turns to the 
audience.

“Let me NOT to the marriage OF true

This class is a lot bigger than the one in San Francisco. 
Its students more varied in age and ethnicity. But 
everyone in it is as puzzled as they were up North. 

TOMMY

“Love is not love. Which alters when it 
alternation finds.” 

ANGLE on the TEACHER (50s, goateed, ponytail poking out 
of his fedora). He’s horrified.
TEACHER

Stop.

The Teacher stands. Tommy picks himself up off the 
ground. 

What... exactly... are you doing?

TEACHER

Sonnet. You know sonnet? 

TOMMY

TEACHER

Yes Tommy, I know what a sonnet is. I 
guess what I’m asking is why on Earth 
would you choose to do that today.

Tommy doesn’t understand the question. 

TEACHER

Have you seen yourself? I mean, no 
offense brother but look at you. You’re a 
scary dude. 

Tommy is very offended by this.

you’d make a perfect villain...

Tommy looks like he might cry. He jumps down off the 
platform, angry.

TOMMY
I am NOT villain. 

He grabs his coat off the chair and storms out of the 
room. The Teacher calls after him.

Hey, I’m just trying to help --

Greg! We must go out tonight! Maybe go 
dancing or a movie. Have you seen this 
“Talented Ripley Man?” 

GREG

Oh, uh, no but... actually Amber and I 
have this birthday party... 

Tommy pretends he isn’t bothered. He’s not a great actor. 
Greg feels bad.

Would you like to come with us?

GREG

EXT ROOFTOP BIRTHDAY PARTY - LATER
Amber and Greg enter with Tommy in tow. The place is 
packed with people, streamers and balloons for decoration 
that read “Happy Birthday!” Seeing Amber and Greg, 
VARIOUS PARTYGOERS approach them warmly. Hugs and kisses 
all around. 
Tommy stands back, sunglasses on, distant. Like he’s 
never seen a birthday party before.

Oh, and this is Greg’s roommate Tommy.

AMBER

I don’t like this place.

TOMMY

No more is said. Amber looks at everyone.

AMBER
Let’s have a drink!

LATER. While Greg and Amber seem to know everyone, Tommy 
stands alone in the corner, next to a table of food. He 
picks up a carrot, sniffs it, then puts it back. 
Tommy is approached by HENRY, a friendly partygoer.

HENRY

Try the onion dip. I made it myself.
I made all of this.

(beat)

Tommy looks at the food. Then back at Henry. Suspicious, 
Tommy takes a small taste.

It’s disgusting. I hate it.
Henry, insulted, turns and walks away.

TOMMY

HENRY 

(under his breath)

Wow. People are so strange these days.

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 38

Tommy ignores him. Alone, he spots Greg and Amber across 
the room, sitting on the steps arm in arm. 
She laughs at something he says and then kisses him. He 
takes in this image a long beat. 
Until it’s interrupted by the arriving CAKE. Everyone 
sings “Happy Birthday” to someone. Tommy takes this as 
his opportunity to slip out unseen. CUT TO:

notices.

But you’re good?

Working on anything at the moment.

Awkward silence. Greg starts looking around for Tommy.

GREG

Anyway, good seeing you Sean. I think I’m 
gonna go find my friend --

You mean the weird guy with the long 
hair? I saw him leave like an hour ago.

And this is news to Greg. CUT TO:

Tommy dines by himself at the exclusive LA eatery. Around 
the room, everyone else is on a date or in a big group. 
And then he recognizes SOMEONE (40s, dark suit, slick). 
Movie Producer JASON HAMMER. Tommy puts down his fork, 
stands and approaches this table.

TOMMY

Sorry to interrupt but you are the movie 
producer Jason Hammer.

HAMMER

(not looking up, dismissive)

Nice to see you. Thank you.

Hammer shakes his hand, thinking that will be the end of 
it. His two FEMALE GUESTS look on.

TOMMY
I am Tommy Wiseau.
HAMMER

Ok. 

Tommy just stands there. 

HAMMER

Can I help you, Tommy? We’re kind of in 
the middle of something.

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 40

(not taking hint)

I won't give you the bullshit, I have a 
lot of talent and many great ideas. 
Please... 

From one of his pockets he pulls out a headshot. Hammer 
resists, now clearly annoyed.
HAMMER

This isn't the time or the place.

TOMMY

So tell me time and place and I will meet 
you. 

Tommy waves the Headshot Hammer won’t take in his face.

Come on, man.

HAMMER

Other tables notice the commotion. Seeing this isn’t 
working, Tommy decides to try something else.

“To be. Or not. To be. Is the question.”  

TOMMY

Oh my god.

FEMALE GUEST #1

TOMMY

“Whether it is nobler in the mind. To 
suffer the slings. And the arrows --”

The whole room now is watching this is total disbelief.

Tommy ignores them, soldiering on, his big chance.

TOMMY

“Or to take up the arms against the sea 
of trouble..”

And now SECURITY has arrived. They grab Tommy. As he’s 
being carted off:

Give me chance Mr. Hammer! One chance! 

TOMMY

HAMMER

Yeah. I'll give you a call if we decide 
to remake Swamp Thing. 

Laughter from Hammer’s Guests. Tommy is enraged. 

TOMMY

(bangs on the table)

You are a swamp thing, I am Tommy Wiseau!

Greg sighs. Both of them sit there a beat. Greg sees how 
low Tommy is.

But we can’t give up. 

GREG

Tommy doesn’t seem so sure.
GREG

Hey. Hey, look at me. When they told 
James Dean he wasn't good enough, did he 
listen to them?

This approach gets Tommy's attention.

GREG

Fuck that, no, he ignored them. And he 
showed them all. And that's what we'll do 
too.

Tommy thinks about that.

I just wish I knew how.

TOMMY

They stand there, together, a long beat.

Maybe we should make our own movie.

A beat. Greg has no idea what to say. On closer 
examination, we see he’s grown a beard, filled out a 
little. 
SUPER: May 7, 2001 (Five Months Later)

TOMMY
So what do you say?

About what?

GREG

I’m gonna make this thing. 

TOMMY

You’re gonna MAKE it?

GREG

I have script, I have money -- 

TOMMY

GREG
You have money?!

TOMMY 

I have investors. Is no problem. I have 
director too. And star -- 

Wait a minute, what director? What star? 

GREG 

TOMMY

Who do you think? Me! I already tell you 
this! You don’t listen?  

Greg is in shock. 

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 45

TOMMY

It’s like you say - Hollywood rejects us, 
we do it ourselves. 

Greg’s eyes go wide. Excitement building. 
Tommy puts the script back on the table.

TOMMY

Behold - “The Room.” 
No one has read it yet. And so today, you 
will be first. 

(beat)

Tommy sits back, expecting Greg to read it in front of 
him. 

GREG
Oh you mean now?

TOMMY

You must prepare yourself physically and 
emotionally. 

Tommy sits back again, expectant. Greg has no choice but 
to read. He opens it up to the first page. Tommy puts his 
hand on it. 

And remember... is copyrighted.

TOMMY

Greg nods. Tommy takes his hand away. Greg starts to 
read. 
SERIES OF SHOTS as Greg turns the pages. We see FLASHES 
of the screenplay:
- “LISA: I am not a slave here, am I?”
- “TOMMY: Old man donkey lets me know today.”
- “LISA’S MOTHER: Get your pretty little buns in here, 
Lisa.”
Greg is having a tough time making sense of the pages. 
Tommy sees that on his face.
TOMMY

I apologize if some of it is over your 
head. 

Yeah, I think... That must be it.

GREG

Greg reads some more. Tommy watches him closely.
Eventually, Greg turns the last page. Tommy looks up, his 
eyes pleading for compliments. 

Well...?

TOMMY

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 46

A long beat.

I mean... it’s good.

GREG

Tommy nods, excited.

And of course you will play “Mark.” 

TOMMY

GREG

You’re serious? Me?
TOMMY

Is big part, no? Second lead...

Greg looks at him, awed.

GREG
(excited)
Tommy, that’s --

I write part just for you. 

TOMMY

GREG
(realizes)

Wait, the guy who stabs his friend in the 
back and steals his girl --

TOMMY

(grabs the script)

You don’t want to do it, fine. Maybe 
Johnny Dapp is available...

No I want to do it. I do...

GREG

Tommy sits back in the chair, pleased. Greg looks at him, 
still in disbelief.

You’re really gonna make this thing? 

GREG

TOMMY 

No, Greg. We’re gonna make this thing.  
Together. 

(beat)

Greg and Tommy lock eyes. They’re fucking doing this!

AND WE CUT TO:

INT BIRNS & SAWYER PRODUCTION SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
One of Hollywood’s best known rental houses for 
professional filmmakers. Equipment, stages, you name it, 
they lease it. 

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 47

Sales rep PETER ANWAY leads Tommy and Greg across the 
studio.

PETER

... every assortment of lenses and 
cameras, both digital and film...

Tommy admires the equipment although it’s clear he 
doesn’t know what any of it does. 

PETER
You’ll notice we have top of the line 
Arriflex lights...

Peter waves over BILL MEURER (60s) from his corner 
office.

PETER

... and here’s the owner of our facility. 
Bill Meurer, this is Tommy and Greg, the 
guys I was telling you about.

BILL

(shakes their hands)

Pleasure to meet you and welcome. How 
long is your shoot?
TOMMY

However long it takes.

Bill looks to Peter who silently signals “let it go.”

Terrific!

BILL

Peter keeps on smiling.

PETER

Well, like I said, you’ll find everything 
you need here at Birns & Sawyer. Rentals 
start at -

Not rent. Buy.

TOMMY

Everyone looks at Tommy, confused.

I’m sorry, you said - ?

PETER

I buy equipment. Yes.

TOMMY

PETER

Tommy, that’s... why would you do that, 
you don’t have to --

TOMMY

“The Room” is first class production. No 
Mickey Mouse stuff. 

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 48

Bill and Peter exchange a glance.

BILL

Hey, customer’s always right, right? So, 
uh, you looking to shoot 35 or HD?

Tommy clearly has no idea what that means.

I shoot both.

TOMMY

Peter and Bill are flabbergasted. Greg tries to be 
helpful.

GREG

I think he’s asking if you want to shoot 
on digital or film.
TOMMY

My ears work. I want to shoot with both 
cameras. 

But... you can’t do both. 

BILL

Why not?

TOMMY

PETER

You would need twice the equipment, twice 
the crew... They’re not even lit the same 
-- It’s just not done. 

TOMMY

So what you’re saying is... I will be 
first. 

PETER

What I’m saying is... NO ONE. WOULD EVER. 
Do it.

TOMMY

Exactly. 
I am not no one. I am Wiseau.

(beat)

Greg high fives Tommy. Bill and Peter are stunned. Who 
are these guys? Peter is about to respond when Bill 
intervenes.

Can you gentlemen give us a moment?

BILL

Bill and Peter step off to the side. We can’t hear what 
they’re saying but they talk animatedly while keeping a 
keen eye on Tommy and Greg. After a few more beats, Peter 
and Bill return. Their attitude very different. 

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 49

PETER

So we talked about it. We’ll sell you all 
the equipment you need. And we’ll give 
you a reduced rate on everything if you 
decide to shoot here.

Good. I like this spot.

TOMMY

Peter looks to Bill. They’re trying to contain 
themselves.

Terrific! Sounds like we have a deal. 

PETER

INT PRODUCTION OFFICE - LATER
Tommy fidgets, seemingly restless, as Peter introduces 
RAPHAEL SMARDJA (30s, arty professional) and SANDY 
SCHKLAIR (affably disheveled, a Selleck mustache and 
hefty glasses).

PETER

This is Raphael, one of our most 
experienced DPs.

Tommy looks at Greg.

GREG

(whispers to Tommy)

Director of Photography.

DP, yes, sure --

TOMMY

PETER

...and Sandy Schklair, script supervisor 
on how many --

32.

32 shows!

SANDY

PETER

I’m a director too. I’ve done several --

SANDY

Tommy seems very impatient.  
TOMMY

Great, everyone hired. I need to get back 
to --

RAPHAEL
Wait, shouldn’t we discuss your vision 
for the movie first?

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 50

SANDY

(fingering the screenplay)

And I certainly have a couple thoughts 
about this script --

TOMMY

You leave thinking to me, my friends. Do 
your jobs, everyone wins.

Sandy laughs but then sees Tommy is serious.

Oh.

SANDY

Do you have a line producer?

RAPHAEL

What’s a line producer?

TOMMY

Raphael looks at Sandy a beat.

Whatever it is, Greg can do it.

TOMMY

This is news to Greg.

Who’s Greg?

SANDY

Greg raises his hand, a little uncertain. 

GREG

I’m Greg. 
I’m also playing “Mark.”

(beat)

Raphael and Sandy look at Greg, confused. What the fuck 
is happening? Greg just shrugs. Buckle up, gang.

SMASH CUT TO:

INSERT: BACKSTAGE MAGAZINE from May 2001.
QUICK ZOOM: the corner of the very last page. A small 
advertisement reads, “OPEN CASTING CALL - MAJOR MOTION 
PICTURE. SERIOUS ACTORS ONLY. NO AMATEUR STUFF.”

INT PRODUCTION OFFICE - HALLWAY - DAY
Filled with aspiring actors who, like Greg and Tommy, are 
hoping this is the one, the big break. 

INT PRODUCTION OFFICE - AUDITION ROOM - DAY
A long plastic table separates Tommy and Greg from the 
ASPIRING ACTRESS. 

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 51

That will be all, thank you.

TOMMY

The Actress smiles politely and walks out the door. Tommy 
immediately turns to Greg.

TOMMY

My God. You see that? That is not Lisa. 
Lisa is All-American girl. Very 
beautiful. Very sexy. Like Angelica 
Jolie. Ugh, why is this so hard?!

Greg opens the door for the next aspirant, JESSIE (20s, 
perky, girl next door).

Jessie Howard.

GREG

Jessie comes in, smiling, confident. This is someone who 
has been on a lot of auditions. Nothing fazes her. Not 
even Tommy who takes a long beat to creepily eye her up 
and down. After which he just says:

You may begin. 

TOMMY

A beat. Jessie turns to Greg. 
JESSIE

Um... are there sides or...?

TOMMY

No one sees script until they absolutely 
must. 

Ah. Woody Allen-style.

JESSIE

TOMMY

Young lady, this is not cartoon. This is 
serious movie. My god. 

Jessie looks to Greg for help. Doesn’t get any. CUT TO:
A DIFFERENT ACTRESS...

ACTRESS #2

(beat)

Ok, um... can you at least tell me 
something about the part?

TOMMY
The part is Lisa. 

A THIRD ACTRESS...

ACTRESS #3

And is Lisa... good, bad, funny, sweet, 
happy, angry --

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 52

She is Lisa.

TOMMY

BACK TO Jessie, who stands there, at a loss. Tommy is 
getting annoyed.

TOMMY
Your Mom just die! 
JESSIE

Excuse me?

TOMMY

It is called acting. I am asking you to 
show me emotion!

Jessie looks to Greg again. Nope. Nothing weird here.

Your Mom just die. Go!

TOMMY

On Jessie’s face, pretty stunned, CUT TO:
SERIES OF SHOTS - Different Actresses Trying Out for Lisa

ACTRESS #1

(fake crying)
I miss her so much.

You just win lottery! Go!

TOMMY

ACTRESS #2
Oh my god, I won! I won!

(beat)

Now you get parking ticket.

TOMMY

ACTRESS #2
Dammit, no, not again!

(beat, trying her best)

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

TOMMY

Your sister is lesbian.
ACTRESS #3

My... what?

LATER. A petite, bubbly, somewhat timid blonde auditions 
for Tommy and Greg. This is JULIETTE DANIELLE.

Michelle is best friend of Lisa.

TOMMY

She waits for more instruction but Tommy says nothing.

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 53

So what am I supposed to do?

JULIETTE

TOMMY

(like it’s obvious)

Be best friend.

CUT TO:
LATER. Greg in the hallway taping something to the wall. 
Tommy emerges from one of the rooms.

I need you to find me a bed. 

TOMMY

GREG
(confused)

Why? Are you tired?

LATER. Tommy and a YOUNG STARLET lie on a MATTRESS that 
now sits in the middle of the audition room. Tommy 
explains:

Lisa is great love of Johnny’s life.

TOMMY

MODEL/ACTRESS
And who’s playing Johnny?

I am.

TOMMY

MODEL/ACTRESS

(beat)

Yeah... I don’t think I’ll be able to 
work this into my schedule. Nice meeting 
you, though. 

And she practically runs out of there. 

You think the bed is a little much?

GREG

TOMMY

(smiling)

Don’t be jealous. Who’s next?!

INT POQUITO MAS - NIGHT
Amber and Greg sit at the counter. 

GREG

Well we still don’t have a Lisa but I 
think we’re ready. 
AMBER
I gotta hand it to Tommy. He’s weird but 
he comes though. 

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 54

Yeah. 

GREG

Amber puts a WRAPPED GIFT on the table. Greg looks at 
her. What’s this?

AMBER
I’m proud of you.

Greg unwraps the gift to reveal a KEY. He’s confused.

AMBER

This way you can come and go as you 
please. No pressure or anything. I just 
thought --

I love it. Thank you. 

GREG

They kiss. A nice moment.

CUT TO:

INT TOMMY’S CAR - THE NEXT MORNING
Tommy in the Driver’s seat. Greg in the Passenger’s seat. 
The car is parked in the alley outside the Studio. They 
look at one another. It is time. And we CUT TO:

EXT BIRNS & SAWYER STUDIO - SAME
In SLO-MO, Tommy and Greg emerge from the car.
SUPER: June 12, 2002 - DAY 1
They walk through the alley to the soundstage. They 
enter:

INT BIRNS & SAWYER SOUNDSTAGE - SAME
Which has been constructed to look exactly like the real 
alley outside. 
Sandy and Raphael stand by a DOLLY (with two different 
kinds of CAMERAS on it). A CREW of Gaffers, Electricians, 
Prop people and the like mill about. It’s a real movie 
set. 
Tommy surveys the scene. Claps his hands and yells:

Everyone, gather! Come here!

TOMMY

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 55

They do as instructed. We see the whole cast of “The 
Room” including: Juliette (as “Michelle”), PHILIP (the 
actor playing “Denny”), CAROLYN (the actress playing 
“Lisa’s Mom”), DAN (playing ”Chris-R”) SCOTT HOLMES (as 
“Mike”) and KYLE VOGT (”Peter”). 
Tommy turns to a YOUNG KID holding a CAMCORDER.

TOMMY
Markus, you ready?

The Kid nods, points the Video Camera at Tommy, its red 
light starts to blink. 

TOMMY

Today is our top of the mountain day. The 
day we begin the first steps of a great 
journey. After today, who among us will 
ever be the same? 

Applause all around. Speech is a little over the top but 
the cast is excited. They’re making a movie!

TOMMY

This play will work if the chemistry 
between all the characters makes sense. 
Human behavior and betrayal applies to 
all of us. It exists within ourselves. 

Now it’s getting a little weird. Even Greg isn’t sure 
what he’s talking about. Markus continues to record the 
whole thing as Tommy continues...

TOMMY

You love somebody. Do you? What is love? 
You think you have everything, but you 
don’t have anything. 

The cast starts looking at one another. What is happening 
right now? Tommy isn’t done. 
TOMMY

You have to have hope and spirit. Be an 
optimist. But can you handle all your 
human behavior or other’s behavior? You 
don’t want to be good, but great.
THE ROOM!

(beat)

More applause. Raphael and Sandy lock eyes. Holy shit.

TOMMY
One other thing...

Tommy points to a curtained-off area at the back of the 
lot with a sign that reads “Director Only.” It’s a toilet 
with a curtain for a door.

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 56

TOMMY

This is private bathroom. Cost me many 
dollars so is only for me. No one use it.

SANDY

You know there’s a bathroom, like, right 
over there. With a door and everything...

TOMMY

(like Sandy is crazy)

This is real movie set.

SANDY

(WTF)

Ok!
After a beat:

Enough pet talk. Let’s make a movie!

TOMMY

INT ALLEY SET - LATER
Raphael sets up both the digital and film cameras with 
his crew.

RAPHAEL
Ready first scene...

WE TRACK with Greg as passes the cameras on his way 
towards the set.
Dan (playing the drug dealer Chris-R) paces incessantly, 
practicing his intense over-the-top dialogue. 

I want my FUCKING money, motherfucker!

CHRIS-R

Greg slaps him on the back, encouraging. He walks on, 
sees Tommy standing with Philip (playing the man-child 
”Denny”), “blocking” the scene. 

TOMMY

So he play with basketball here. And then 
you come in here. Demand the money.

Greg nods along in support. Until Sandy appears.

Can I ask a question? 

SANDY

Tommy turns to Sandy. Annoyed by this intrusion.

SANDY

If Denny already bought the drugs, why 
does Chris-R want the money now? What 
kind of drug dealer doesn’t require up 
front payment?

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 57

Greg too finds this odd. Tommy is about to answer when:

PHILIP HALDIMAN

Also... can I just call him Chris instead 
of Chris-R?

TOMMY

His name is Chris-R. You call him Chris-
R.

Yeah but why?

PHILIP HALDIMAN

Cause he is gangster.

TOMMY

Philip looks at Greg. Can you help? But Greg and Tommy 
are in lock step.

Gangster.

GREG

Tommy makes to move on but Philip stops him.

Oh, uh, also how old am I supposed to be?

PHILIP HALDIMAN

I don’t know. 15, 16...

TOMMY

Both Greg and Philip find that odd. (Philip is quite 
clearly in mid 20s.) But maybe this isn’t the time to say 
so...

Ok, sure...

PHILIP HALDIMAN

TOMMY

And don’t be Brando today. You will hurt 
yourself.

Philip isn’t sure what that means. Raphael comes over.

Picture’s up...

RAPHAEL

Tommy walks over to the Camera(s). He nods to Greg, who 
returns it. It’s really happening! 

Roll sound. Roll camera...

RAPHAEL

Tommy closes his eyes, takes a second to appreciate this 
moment. And then: A CAMERA ASSISTANT holds up the 
CLAPPERBOARD.

Action!

TOMMY

We see the 1st Take through the CAMERA’S POV. 

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 58

“Hey Denny.”

“CHRIS-R”

“Hey Chris-R, I’ve been looking for you.”

“DENNY”

“CHRIS-R”
“Do you have my money?”

“DENNY”

“Your money is coming. It will be here in 
a few minutes.”

“CHRIS-R”

(pulls gun, grabs Denny)

“I need my money!”

“Just give me 5 minutes...”

“DENNY”

They wrestle a few moments longer than they need to 
until:

TOMMY

Cut!
I love it! 

(he approaches them)

Greg does a fist pump. So proud. 
Everyone else looks at each other like “what the fuck was 
that?” Sandy approaches Tommy.

Did you want to do another?

SANDY

Why? That was perfect. 

TOMMY

And off his face, we HEAR:

And that’s a wrap on day one, everybody!

SANDY (OVERLAP)

INT BIRNS AND SAWYER SOUNDSTAGES - NEXT DAY
Greg walks through the CREW, taking it all in. His 
enthusiasm for being on a movie set still evident on his 
face. This is the dream. 
SUPER: DAY 4
He walks towards Tommy who is sitting in make-up, 
studying his lines. AMY, the make-up artist, tries to do 
her work while Tommy reads lines.

“Oh hi, Mark.”

(beat)

TOMMY

(MORE)

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 59

TOMMY (CONT'D)

“Oh. Hi Mark!”
“Oh hi! Mark.”

(beat)

Tommy is about to make his screen debut and he’s nervous.

GREG

You’re always nervous for your on-screen 
debut. You should have seen me, I almost 
threw up. 

Tommy looks at Greg, more annoyed than comforted.

GREG

You’re gonna do great, Tommy. I promise. 
Just relax. 

Sandy appears, pointing to his watch.

Five minutes.

SANDY

Tommy stands. Looks around the place. Can’t sit still.

TOMMY
Where is wardrobe?

He walks over to the clothing racks. No one seems to know 
where the costume designer is.  

Do I have to do everything myself?!

TOMMY

Tommy starts grabbing CLOTHES off the rack. Picks a SHIRT 
and a SPORTS COAT that neither fit nor match. He tries 
both on and likes what he sees. 
SAFOWA, the Costume Designer, shows up in the nick of 
time.

TOMMY

Where have you been?
SAFOWA

I just went to grab ties. 

TOMMY

Well now I’m already dressed. You’re too 
late. 

Tommy looks around for more props. Safowa has no idea 
what he’s doing. He grabs some SCRUNCHIES, LOTION 
BOTTLES, HAIR GEL, and a wad of fake CASH. He stuffs all 
of them in his pants pockets. 
SAFOWA

You’re gonna film the scene with all 
those things in your pockets?

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 60

I keep my stuff sweetie.

TOMMY

He walks off towards the set.
SAFOWA

Can I at least take a picture for 
continuity?

Continuity - is in your forehead.

TOMMY

And with that, he’s gone. Safowa turns to Greg.

SAFOWA
What does that mean?

And... action!

SANDY (OVERLAP)

INT ROOFTOP SET - MOMENTS LATER
The crew is set up to film an OUTHOUSE which will double 
as the rooftop’s entry point. The door opens and Tommy as 
“Johnny” comes out.

“JOHNNY”

“It is not...”
Line!

(beat)

“True.” “It’s not true.”

SANDY

Tommy holds up his hand in apology. Re-enters the 
outhouse. 

Going again. And... action.

SANDY

Tommy comes out again.

“JOHNNY”
“It’s not true. I...”
Line!

(beat)

Sandy looks at Greg. Then back to Tommy

SANDY

(flatly)

“It’s not true. I didn’t hit her. It’s 
bullshit. I did not.”

Tommy nods, goes back into the outhouse. 

And... action!

SANDY

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 61

From the POV of the CAMERA, we see Tommy come out: 

“JOHNNY”

“It’s bullshit. I hit her, it’s 
bullshit...”

Tommy keeps walking, until in fact he’s completely out of 
frame. Sandy can’t believe it.

SANDY

Dammit! Cut! 
(beat)
Tommy... your mark.
TOMMY

(pointing to Greg)

He’s Mark.

SANDY
No, your mark. Where you need to stand. 
To be in the shot.

Tommy realizes his mistake. Goes back in. Sandy exhales. 
Tommy comes back out, staring at his feet:

“JOHNNY”

“It’s not true...”
SANDY

Look up!

Tommy can’t look up and talk at the same time.

in.

So how’s shooting going?

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 63

GREG
Um, you know... 

She doesn’t know. And neither really does Greg. But he 
wants to believe.

Good. I think. It’s coming together.   

GREG

Amber nods.

And Tommy? How’s he doing?

AMBER

GREG

He’s... you know... he’s Tommy. He’s 
trying hard but... I think he’s nervous. 
He’s put a lot into this thing.
A beat. Amber smiles, can’t help herself. 

AMBER

(in “Tommy voice”)

I am Tommy Wiseau. Great American film 
director. 

Greg laughs.

AMBER

(in “Tommy voice”)

This is movie for the ages. Classic 
drama. Like the “Gone With Wind” or the 
“Dance With Wolves...”

Greg finds this hilarious. They laugh together. 

AMBER

Oh man, what are you gonna do if it’s 
terrible?

GREG
What do you mean?
AMBER

I mean... isn’t this gonna be on your 
IMDB page?

This thought hadn’t occurred to Greg until now. Greg 
thinks about it. 

It won’t be terrible. 

GREG

Amber doesn’t say anything.
GREG

It’s gonna be great, you’ll see. 

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 64

Amber picks up the script. Starts to browse through it. 
Greg sits back in the chair, thinking about what she 
said. On his face, we CUT TO:

INT TOMMY’S OFFICE - NIGHT
Decorated wall to wall with American flags and Christmas 
decorations. Tommy is alone, watching some of the BEHIND 
THE SCENES FOOTAGE that Markus has shot: Sandy and 
Raphael in video village during one of Tommy’s 
performances. We hear:

RAPHAEL (O.S.)

Is he gonna do that accent the whole 
movie?

Pretty sure that’s just how he talks. 

SANDY (O.S.)

Tommy watches this like a detective, making mental notes. 
He’s interrupted by a KNOCK. It’s Juliette, the actress 
playing ”Michelle.”

May I come in? 

JULIETTE

She does, admiring all the office decorations. 

JULIETTE

Christmas in June.
TOMMY

(quickly turning off the TV)

What?

No, I mean, I like it. And the flags...

JULIETTE

I am American. Just like you. 

TOMMY

JULIETTE

Of course. Yeah... 
TOMMY

So what is it? As you can see I’m very 
busy....

She sits on a chair across from Tommy’s desk.

JULIETTE

Is it true you still haven’t found a 
Lisa?

Why, do you know someone?

TOMMY

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 65

JULIETTE

Well I was thinking... maybe I could do 
it. 

TOMMY

(beat, looks at her)

Young lady...

JULIETTE

I know, I know. I don’t have much 
experience but... give me a chance. I 
might surprise you.

Tommy looks at her as if regarding her for the first 
time. 

TOMMY

Lisa is aggressive. Passionate. Very 
determined. Are you those things?

I wouldn’t be here if I wasn’t.

JULIETTE

Juliette stands, slowly moves closer to Tommy.

TOMMY

And you also must be ok with the kissing 
stuff? There is lots of --

As if on cue, she kisses Tommy! He’s surprised but 
quickly returns it and an intense make out ensues. A few 
beats later, Juliette breaks away. Shrugs. Exits. Leaving 
a very thrown Tommy with much to think about. 

My god.

TOMMY

“Yeah man, you never know...”

GREG AS “MARK” (OVERLAP)

INT ROOFTOP SET - LATER
And now the rest of that scene. Tommy sits in a chair, 
Greg as “Mark” stands over him. 

“MARK”

“People are pretty strange these days. I 
used to know a girl she had a dozen guys. 
One of them found out, beat her up so 
bad, she ended up in the hospital.”

Which causes Tommy to laugh. No one can believe it.
SUPER: DAY 23

CUT TO:

“MARK”

“... she had a dozen guys. One of them 
found out, beat her up so bad, she ended

Tommy laughs at that again. Sandy and Raphael share 
another glance. Holy shit!

Cut!

SANDY

Sandy walks over to Tommy.

What?

TOMMY

SANDY

The story he’s telling you - the one you, 
yourself, wrote - it’s not a funny story, 
Tommy.

CUT TO:

“MARK”

“... he beat her up so bad she ended up 
in the hospital.”

Tommy laughs uproariously again.
“JOHNNY”

What a story, Mark!

Sandy looks at Raphael who just shakes his head. Let’s 
just keep going. CUT TO:

EXT BIRNS & SAWYER - PARKING LOT - END OF DAY
Greg walks with Tommy.

GREG

Good news on the Lisa front. I know a 
girl, a really good actress, just got 
back in town --

Juliette is playing Lisa.

TOMMY

No, Juliette is playing Michelle.

GREG

TOMMY

Not anymore. She show up one day, very 
pushy, manipulative. Her competition is 
vicious! Perfect for Lisa!

GREG

Tommy, I’m the line producer. You have to 
tell me these things...

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 67

TOMMY
But I’m director. 
GREG

I know, I just... I want this to be good. 

TOMMY
It won’t be good.
It will be GREAT.

(beat)

And Greg wants to believe this. But still:

So who’s playing Michelle then?

GREG

Tommy didn’t think about that. Oh shit.

GREG

You’re kidding, right? She shoots 
tomorrow!

EXT BIRNS & SAWYER - SOUNDSTAGE - NIGHT
Greg walks ROBYN PARIS (20s, brunette, savvy) down to the 
other end of the alley.

GREG

I’m sorry it’s so last minute. I know how 
this looks. 

ROBYN

It looks like I’m going to be murdered. 
Is anyone else auditioning?

Tommy waits for them at the end of the alley in his 
pirate/vampire outfit.  

Hello.

Robyn smiles.

Hi there.

TOMMY

ROBYN

Tommy looks at her a beat. 

Do you believe in love?

TOMMY

Sorry?

ROBYN

TOMMY

Are you willing to give up your mind, 
soul, and body to inhabit Michelle?

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 68

ROBYN

(beat)

I mean, yeah I think so --

Great! You got the part! 

TOMMY

On Robyn’s face, unsure how to feel. She turns to Greg.

Welcome to “The Room!”

GREG

INT EL COYOTE - LATER
Jam packed and loud. Tommy sits with Greg and Amber in a 
small booth. 

TOMMY
(to Waiter)

I said hot water. This is not hot. Why is 
everything a problem these days?!

The Waiter scurries off. Awkward silence. Amber looks at 
Greg. Sending him a message. Greg seems a little nervous. 

GREG

So Tommy... the reason we, uh, brought 
you here... We’ve been talking and... 
We want to move in together. 

(beat)

Tommy looks at them, confused.

TOMMY

That’s impossible. My place can’t handle 
the three of us.
GREG

No that’s --

Greg and I are moving in together.

AMBER

TOMMY

(to Greg)

What? 
Why?

GREG

We found this place in Studio City. One 
bedroom. Nice little yard in the back. 

A very long beat. Tommy sees Amber take Greg’s hand and 
hold it. He fixates on that hand for a beat. Tries to 
mask whatever darkness comes over him.

What about the movie?

TOMMY

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 69

That confuses Greg. 

What about it? I’ll be there Monday.

GREG

Tommy shakes his head, anger building. 

GREG

Tommy, just cause I’m moving out, that 
doesn’t mean --

Tommy stands abruptly. 

You don’t understand.

TOMMY

Tommy looks at them, stewing, furious. And walks out of 
the restaurant in a huff. Greg looks at Amber. Uh-oh. CUT 
TO:

INT HOLLYWOOD APARTMENT - SAME
Greg enters, having carried most of his STUFF out to the 
car. One more thing left to do:

Tommy?

GREG

He walks into the BATHROOM where Tommy is shirtless, 
staring at his body in the mirror.

Tommy, we’re leaving. 

GREG

Tommy says nothing. 

Can we at least talk about it?

GREG

Tommy continues to admire himself in the mirror. Greg 
tries one more time.

Cause I feel like maybe we should --

GREG

And then, without even turning:

TOMMY

Look at my arms. Not bad, yeah. Like big 
strong kid...?

Greg is disappointed. 

GREG

Yeah, man.
(beat)
I’ll see ya.

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 70

Tommy doesn’t even turn around. Greg walks out, a little 
saddened. 
And only then does Tommy turn, hurt and betrayed and 
unable to hide it any longer.

INT BEDROOM SET - ANOTHER DAY
Juliette lies in bed, the covers closely tucked around 
her naked body as her hair is touched up. Documentary 
Markus films her close-up in the most pervy of ways. 
SUPER: DAY 44
Juliette is clearly a little uncomfortable but she’s 
making the best of it. Until:
Tommy steps onto set, wearing nothing but a sock on his 
dick. 
Instead of getting into bed he starts barking at the 
crew:

TOMMY

You. We need more lights. And you, help 
him. You - come too. Raphael!

RAPHAEL

What is it, Tommy?
TOMMY

This shot is very important. It must look 
like “The Titanic.” 
RAPHAEL

“The Titanic.”

Yes.

TOMMY

Trust me, it does.

RAPHAEL

Raphael walks off. As more crew gather around, Juliette 
pulls the covers up higher. She looks to Greg - help me. 
He approaches Tommy.

GREG
Tommy, can you - 

(holds his script down to 

cover Tommy’s junk)

Is this really necessary?

TOMMY

I have to show my ass or this movie won’t 
sell. 

Well at least have a closed set. 

SANDY

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 71

TOMMY

Closed set? Why? I want everyone to see 
this. 
You especially.

(then, to Greg)

Greg doesn’t know what that means. Meanwhile, Tommy gets 
in bed. Juliette tenses up. Even Tommy can see that.

TOMMY

Brad Pitt did this in The Legends of the 
Falls. 

JULIETTE

Can we put some music on? You know, to 
help the mood. Like maybe an Alicia Keys 
song? 

TOMMY

We are not here to promote other people’s 
work.
OK everyone gather closer. And... action!
He kisses her and she tries her best to return the 
passion. Tommy pulls down the sheet to expose her 
breasts, but then he suddenly stops.

(barks at crew)

Cut, cut... this is no good.

TOMMY

Everyone is confused.

What’s the problem?

JULIETTE

Tommy points at Juliette’s shoulders.

TOMMY

We can’t have this on camera.
See all this stuff here... these pimples 
and things.

(snapping at Make-Up)

He continues pointing at her body in front of everyone. 
Juliette is horrified.

Here and here. And what is this?

TOMMY

Greg has rarely seen his friend so rude.

TOMMY

(still pointing)

Take this shit out. We can’t have this.

Juliette starts to cry. 

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 72

GREG

C’mon man, do you have to say it like 
that?

TOMMY

This is American movie! It needs to be 
sexy. She needs to be beautiful.

She grabs the bedsheet and runs off. 

GREG
Can I talk to you?

Tommy, slightly annoyed, walks with Greg off to the side 
away from the others.

Tommy...

GREG

TOMMY

I know. I’m a little hard on Juliette 
sometimes. 

It’s not just Juliette --

GREG

TOMMY

You think Stanley Kubrick was nice to his 
actors? Or Alfred Hitchcock? 

Greg thinks about that. 

TOMMY

Let me tell you something. In that book 
you gave me, about the Hitchcock... there 
is this movie called “Birds.” 

Yeah, I’ve seen “The Birds.”

GREG

TOMMY

When they make this movie, Hitchcock 
would terrorize his actors. Lock them in 
rooms, throw birds at them, real birds! 
Nasty stuff. They would cry everyday. 
That movie wins every award. Is Mr. 
Hitchcock a bad man? No. He is great 
director. The very word “director,” it 
comes from the word “dictator.” I rest my 
case.

(beat)

And that strangely makes sense to Greg.

TOMMY

If anyone has reason to be upset, quite 
frankly it’s me, you know. I give them 
jobs. I give them salary. I’ve spent more 
than five million dollars on this movie 
so far -- 

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 73

GREG
Wait, seriously?

TOMMY

-- and no one is grateful! No one 
respects my vision! I know what they say. 
I can hear them. No one trusts me, Greg. 
Not even you.

I trust you.

Do you?

GREG

TOMMY

And he does. Despite everything, he still does. 

I wouldn’t still be here if I didn’t. 

GREG

Tommy nods. Puts his hands on Greg’s shoulders. Walks 
back out to the SET. 
Juliette, ever the professional, is back in bed faking it 
with Tommy. Tommy rolls off her, smiles.

TOMMY
Let’s do it again.

No one thinks they need another. 

Take 15...

SANDY

Tommy begins to hump Juliet. Everyone watches. He seems 
to be thrusting into her at a weird angle.

SANDY

He knows where her vagina is, right? Why 
is he fucking her belly button? 

Tommy rolls off her, smiles.
TOMMY

Cut... Reset. I want more passion.

No, fuck that! 

RAPHAEL

Tommy is stunned by this outburst.

RAPHAEL

You embarrassed that girl in front of the 
crew. Do it again you’re a dead man. 

What?

TOMMY

You heard me.

RAPHAEL

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 74

RAPHAEL
Ok then you’re fired.
RAPHAEL

What?!

Raphael wants to charge at him. Greg holds him back.

Hey, hey. Everybody cool out. 

GREG

TOMMY

I hear what you say, your jokes -- you...
... and you...
... and you too. All of you!

(to Sandy)
(to the Actors)

The hell are you talking about?

SANDY

TOMMY
Where is Markus?!

Markus emerges from behind the scrim. Camcorder in hand. 
He drops it for the moment. 
TOMMY

(to the Crew)

No, keep filming. Always be filming.
This is Markus. I hire him for 
documentary. “The Making of The Room.” 
Since our 1st day he has been filming 
behind the scenes. Every nasty comment, 
every laugh - he sees it all. And then I 
see it.

RAPHAEL

So what you’re saying is... you’ve been 
spying on your own production.

That’s right!

TOMMY

RAPHAEL
That’s fucking crazy.

TOMMY

So now you know. The next comment, the 
next one to laugh - I don’t care who you 
are, you’ll be out on the street! 

Everyone looks to one another, trying to remember what 
terrible things they probably said behind Tommy’s back. 

RAPHAEL
So am I fired or not?

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 75

TOMMY

(beat)

I give you one more chance.

RAPHAEL

(unenthusiastic)

Terrific. Check the gate.
CREW MEMBER

Checking the gate!

Tommy storms off. Not even Greg knows what to do. Raphael 
sees Markus’s camera up in his grill. With a threatening 
look, Markus turns the camera somewhere else. CUT TO:

EXT AMBER'S APARTMENT - FRONT STEPS - NIGHT
Greg nursing a beer, contemplative. A few empties by his 
side. Amber comes out, dressed for bed.

AMBER

GREG

You ok?

(nods)

Long day.

Production is clearly taking a toll on him. They both see 
it.

AMBER

When this is over, let’s get out of here. 
Take the money you made, start over 
somewhere. 

GREG
You mean leave LA?
AMBER

Why not? What’s so great about LA?

GREG

I’m an actor. I need to be here. And I 
can’t leave now. Things are finally 
starting to happen. 

AMBER

You’re not talking about “The Room,” are 
you?
Greg I read the script. That’s maybe the 
worst thing anyone has ever written. 
Ever. 

(off his look)

It’s... unconventional, sure...

GREG

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 76

AMBER

No it’s bad. And every night you come 
home, completely miserable, with a 
different story of how fucked up 
everything is on that set. Do you really 
think this is gonna work out for you, 
Greg?

GREG

Do you know how many movies had bad 
scripts, troubled productions? Star Wars. 
Jaws. Apocalypse Now. The Shining. And 
every one of those turned out amazing. 

AMBER

Well this won’t, Greg. This isn’t Jaws. 
And Tommy isn’t Stanley Kubrick.

Greg is annoyed by this.

GREG

You don’t really know what you’re talking 
about.  

Amber looks at Greg. His devotion admirable but also 
maybe a little pathetic. We can see in her face Greg’s 
naivete may be losing its appeal.

I hope you’re right. 

AMBER

We hear:

“CLAUDETTE” (OVERLAP)
“Everything goes wrong at once...”

CUT TO:

ANGLE ON TOMMY’S PRIVATE BATHROOM.
Raphael comes out. He looks both ways to make sure Tommy 
didn’t see him. He totally just took a shit in there. 
Mission accomplished. 

CUT TO:

EXT BIRNS & SAWYER STUDIO
Claudette and Juliette sit under the lights, sweating 
bullets. They’ve seemingly been waiting a while. 
SUPER: DAY 68
Greg and the Make-Up Artist fan them down as they 
continue to rehearse.

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 77

CAROLYN AS “CLAUDETTE”

“Nobody wants to help me.”
“And I’m dying.”

(beat)

“You’re not dying.”

JULIETTE AS “LISA”

CAROLYN AS “CLAUDETTE”

“I got the results of the tests back. I 
definitely have breast cancer.”

There’s a commotion and they turn. Tommy has finally 
shown up on set. Sandy looks at his watch.

He’s here, everybody!

SANDY

Tommy ignores him, heads towards Carolyn and Juliette. 
Already in a stint.

Tommy, does this come back? 

CAROLYN

What...?

TOMMY

CAROLYN

The breast cancer.
TOMMY

(beat)
It is twist.

But it never comes back? 

CAROLYN

TOMMY

I don’t have time to explain script to 
you. And what is this? Where is make up? 
You look like you just went swimming in a 
lake?

It’s 100 degrees in here. 

CLAUDETTE

Can we at least get some water? 

JULIETTE

TOMMY

Honey. Don’t forget. No one else in 
Hollywood give you water. 

Juliette reacts, furious. Even Greg is surprised by that.

CLAUDETTE

(to Greg)

Someone’s in a mood today.
Meanwhile, Raphael approaches Tommy. 

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 78

We need to cut the alley scene. 

RAPHAEL

Impossible.

TOMMY

RAPHAEL

No, we have to. We’re already four hours 
behind.

And who’s fault is that?

TOMMY

Raphael can’t believe it.

RAPHAEL
It’s your fault. You showed up three 
hours late - again. 

TOMMY
I’m the director.

Exactly.  

Exactly. 

RAPHAEL

TOMMY

Raphael just throws up his hands. Tommy keeps walking. He 
turns to the crew, pointing to some kleig lights.

Why aren’t these on? 

TOMMY

Tommy, it’s way too hot for --

GREG

TOMMY

IT IS NOT TOO HOT. IT IS NOT TOO HOT 
UNLESS I SAY IT’S HOT!

At which point, Carolyn, the elderly actress playing 
Lisa’s Mom, FAINTS from dehydration. HOLY FUCK!

CUT TO:

EXT BIRNS & SAWYER STUDIO
LATER. Carolyn has some bottled water and a towel. She’s 
eating with Greg and the rest of the actors at a lunch 
table. 

CAROLYN

I’m just tired. I haven’t been sleeping 
well recently. I’ll be fine...

Greg studies her a beat. 

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 79

GREG

(off her look)

Can I ask you something? Why do you do 
it? 
You’ve got a husband, grand-kids. You 
live fifty miles out of town. And you’re 
waking up at 5, driving all this way, for 
what? 

Carolyn smiles.

CAROLYN

We’re actors, Greg. For you, me, people 
like us... even the worst day on a movie 
set is better than the best day doing 
anything else.

Greg and the rest of the actors think about that. She’s 
absolutely right.

PHILIP HALDIMAN

(to Greg)

Can we ask you something? What’s his 
deal? 

Tommy?

GREG

Yeah like where’s he from? 

SCOTT

JULIETTE

How’s he have all this money?
PHILIP HALDIMAN

And what’s the hell is this movie about? 
You’re the only one who’s read all of 
it... 

Greg is about to respond. Robyn interrupts.

(beat)

ROBYN
I have a theory. 
It’s autobiographical. Someone in his 
life was a Denny - kid brother, someone 
he looked out for or something. Someone 
else was a Mark, the better looking 
friend he was always jealous of... 

Greg thinks about that. Robyn continues:

ROBYN

I’m sure there was a Michelle somewhere. 
And a Mike.

They all think about it. It does make sense. 

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 80

JULIETTE

So then who is Lisa? Who broke his heart, 
stabbed him in the back, ruined his life?

ROBYN

Pretty obvious to me...
(beat)
The universe.

Greg shakes his head.

GREG

Look, Tommy is Tommy. He’s a weird guy, 
no question. But I’ll tell you this... 
every time I underestimate him, every 
time I think maybe he’s just out of his 
mind... somehow, someway, Tommy always 
comes through.
You watch. This movie’s gonna make us all 
famous.  

(beat)

That gets some laughs. Clearly none of them believe it.

INT CANTER’S - NIGHT
Greg and Amber are on their way out when Greg notices 
someone waiting in the front of the restaurant. His eyes 
bug out, holy shit. He leans in, conspiratorially:

Shh. Check it out. 

GREG

He gestures with his head, not too subtly. Amber looks 
and sure enough - it’s BRYAN CRANSTON . 

Hey I know him.

AMBER

Yeah no shit, Malcolm in the Middle.

GREG

AMBER

No, I mean... 
(shouts)
Bryan!

Greg’s mouth hits the floor.

Amber, how’s it going?!

BRYAN CRANSTON

AMBER

So good to see you! This is my boyfriend, 
Greg. 

Cranston puts out his hand. Greg shakes it, still in awe. 

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 81

AMBER
He’s also an actor.

Oh yeah? Anything I would have seen?

BRYAN CRANSTON

Um, no, I doubt it.

GREG

A beat of awkward silence. But Bryan’s a pro.

Are you working at the moment?

BRYAN CRANSTON

GREG

Actually, yeah, I’m... shooting this 
movie... 

A movie. Nice! Good for you, man. 

BRYAN CRANSTON

GREG

But I’d love to do TV someday. Sitcoms, 
drama, cop shows - I love all that stuff.

Bryan thinks about this. 

BRYAN CRANSTON

(beat)

Funny you should say that... 
There’s this scene we’re doing next week. 
The boys go missing and Hal and Lois find 
them in the woods. We need a lumberjack. 
You think you could you do that?

Me?

GREG

BRYAN CRANSTON
Well you got that beard... 

That’s...

GREG

Greg is momentarily taken aback. 

GREG

Holy shit, I would love to. Next week, 
did you say?

Tuesday and Wednesday.

BRYAN CRANSTON

GREG

Amazing! Yes. I’m not shooting next week 
at all.

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 82

AMBER

Wait, Greg. 
(beat)
You think Tommy will be cool with this?

GREG
Why wouldn’t he? 

Amber shoots him a look.

Tommy’s my friend. He’ll be happy for me. 

GREG

Amber says nothing to that. Greg turns back to Cranston.

Do I have to do anything?

GREG

BRYAN CRANSTON

(beat)

No, just bring that handsome face of 
yours.  
Oh, and don’t shave. Really sells that 
lumberjack look. 
GREG

I can do that! Yes! Thank you. 

BRYAN CRANSTON

My pleasure.
Good to see you, Amber.

(to Amber)

He hugs Amber goodbye and walks off. Greg and Amber stand 
there a beat.

How do you know Bryan Cranston?!

GREG

Pilates. 

AMBER

INT A DARK BEDROOM - SAME
Tommy, as serious as we’ve ever seen him, kneels down and 
makes the sign of the cross. Then he slowly raises a GUN 
to his mouth. For a moment we might think this is real 
but then Tommy pulls the trigger. The prop makes a tiny 
POP sound.
ANGLE ON GREG, watching with the crew. He sees Tommy fall 
over, start flailing around on the floor. This goes for a 
long while until he grabs Lisa’s RED DRESS from the 
ground - 

CUT!

SANDY (O.S.)

Tommy turns to him, shocked.

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 83

TOMMY

Don’t cut! What are you doing? This is 
real acting!

SANDY

Tommy, if you plan to writhe around you 
should probably do it before you blow 
your brains out, not after.

TOMMY

(beat)

I disagree.

Sandy couldn’t care less at this point. 

RAPHAEL

Can you at least try to stay in the 
frame?

That is your problem. And action!

TOMMY

This time Tommy runs around, trashing the room. Glassware 
and picture frames go flying. He breaks a mirror. He 
pulls out drawers. He grunts and moans throughout the 
rampage. He nearly runs into Markus, the documentary kid, 
filming from off to the side.

“Why? Why?!”

“JOHNNY”

Tommy writhes around on the floor until he grabs the red 
dress... which he then repeatedly rubs on his crotch.

RAPHAEL

(whisper)

Is he... why is he...?

SANDY

(has to look away)

Oh Dear God...

BACK TO TOMMY. Who is very clearly masturbating with the 
dress. Upon finishing, he then SNIFFS the soiled dress! 
Eventually he picks up the gun...

“JOHNNY”
“God... forgive me!”

And pulls the trigger! He falls over and remains 
motionless.
ANGLE ON the entire crew. Stunned silence. No one can 
believe what they just saw.

And... cut?

SANDY

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 84

Tommy sits up, brushes some lint off his pants. Greg 
takes a deep breath. It’s time to ask Tommy for a favor. 
He approaches him, anxiously. 

Dude that was amazing! 

GREG

You think so?

TOMMY

GREG

Totally. So raw and intense. You really 
brought it, man. Seriously. 

TOMMY

(sincere)

Thank you.

Tommy nods to him, is about to walk away.

GREG
Hey, uh, listen... I know it’s last 
minute but, um... 
TOMMY

What is it, Greg, I’m very busy?

GREG
Well, I know tomorrow is the big beard 
shaving scene -- 
TOMMY

I know the schedule.

GREG

So I was hoping we could move that scene 
maybe to next week and I could have 
tomorrow off...

(covers his face)

TOMMY
Why, are you sick?
GREG

No, I - 

TOMMY

(immediately suspicious)

So why you need day off?

Greg isn’t sure he should tell him. Has no idea how he’ll 
react. But he doesn’t want to lie.

GREG

You won’t believe this but... I landed a 
small part on a tv show. Malcolm in the 
Middle. 

Tommy doesn’t like the sound of this at all.

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 85

TOMMY

But you’re a movie actor now. Why you do 
this?

GREG

It’s a big show. Great exposure. Could be 
a real boost for my career.

Tommy considers for a beat. Blank poker face.

What do you have to do on this “Malcolm?” 

TOMMY

GREG
(re: beard)

I don’t know. 
Just have to show up with this I guess. 

Tommy says nothing. Considering Greg’s words carefully.

GREG

Which is why I can’t shave tomorrow. But 
if you move the schedule just a day or 
two... it would really help me out. 

Tommy thinks long and hard about it. And he makes a 
decision:

I’m sorry, Greg. I can’t help you.

TOMMY

GREG

(stunned)

What, why?

TOMMY

Clean shaven Mark has grand entrance at 
start of 3rd Act. This is important 
scene. 

GREG

I know it is. But... we can shoot it next 
week, can’t we?

I’m afraid no. Is impossible.

TOMMY

Tommy...

GREG

TOMMY

I can’t give you special treatment, Greg. 
It would not be not fair to the others.

Greg can’t believe it. By now everyone has stopped what 
they’re doing to listen. 

GREG

C’mon Tommy, Jesus. I’m asking for a 
favor --

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 86

Another favor. All you do is ask favors. 

TOMMY

Greg flinches at that.

TOMMY

I give you place to stay, I write part 
for you, I make this whole movie, Greg, 
for you and for me. And you still want 
more favors. 

And this hurts Greg. Friends don’t do this. But at the 
same time, it’s kinda true.

TOMMY

I’m sorry but my answer is no. So you 
must choose. You do TV show. Or you do 
movie. Our movie. 

Greg is furious. All eyes are on him. What will he 
decide? CUT TO:

INT MAKE-UP TRAILER - MOMENTS LATER
Greg comes in to find Amber there. Her arms folded. Her 
face unable to mask her disappointment. 

I don’t understand you. 

AMBER

Greg ignores her. Sits on the bed, distraught. 

AMBER

That was your chance to get away from 
this guy and you didn’t take it. 

What am I supposed to do?

GREG

AMBER

Say no! Walk out! Tell him to fuck 
himself!

I can’t...

GREG

AMBER

Yes you can. Of course you can. Why can’t 
you?

Cause he’s... my friend -- 

GREG

Amber sighs deeply. Shakes her head. And then she says:

AMBER

You’re so full of shit sometimes, you 
know that? 

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 87

And now he turns to face her.
AMBER

This isn’t about loyalty, or friendship. 
This is about fear. 

Greg looks at her - what is she saying?

AMBER

Your biggest fear is that you’re bad at 
this. That you’d go on to that Malcolm 
set and people would laugh at you. 
But with Tommy around, that wouldn’t 
happen. It would never happen. Cause 
there’d always be somebody worse. 

(beat)

Greg doesn’t want to admit it but she’s making sense.

AMBER

Tommy isn’t your friend, Greg.
He’s your excuse. 

(beat)

Greg looks away, unable to deny it. She squeezes his 
shoulders, walks past him out of the trailer. He watches 
her go and in that moment, he knows, he’s lost her. We 
hear:
SFX: The BUZZ of ELECTRIC CLIPPERS. And we are:

INT BIRNS AND SAWYER SOUNDSTAGES - BATHROOM - DAY
Greg, demoralized beyond repair, is being shaved with a 
straight razor by Amy. If that wasn’t bad enough, Tommy 
is behind him, too close, watching every pass of the 
razor.

TOMMY

Mmm. Slower. Do it slower.
Take your time. 

And then it’s over. Amy lifts Greg’s head up so he can 
see in the mirror. He looks in the mirror, a little 
heartbroken. RACK FOCUS to Tommy, right behind him. 
Cheshire grin and all, purposefully ruining his friend’s 
life. CUT TO:

INT THE ROOM SET - LATER
Tommy, “Denny,” and the ACTOR playing “Peter” stand 
around in tuxedos. Denny inexplicably has a football. 
The DOORBELL rings. Denny opens it and in walks clean-
shaven Greg. Everyone gasps. A “HUGE MOVIE MOMENT.” 

“MARK”
“So... you like it?”

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 88

“You look like a babyface!”

“JOHNNY”

ANGLE on Sandy who looks at Raphael who just shakes his 
head. 

“So you guys wanna play football?”

“DENNY”

“Sure./Great.”

“EVERYONE”

“PETER”
“I don’t think so.”
TOMMY

“Come on... Don’t be chicken. Cheep cheep 
cheep cheep.”
And everyone joins in...

“Cheep cheep cheep cheep.

“EVERYONE”

And.. cut!

SANDY

Tommy turns to him.

Did we get it?

TOMMY

Oh we got it.

SANDY

No one can believe it. CUT TO:

EXT GREG AND AMBER’S APARTMENT - ANOTHER MORNING
Greg waits on a street corner for Tommy. A few moments 
later a VAN pulls up. 
SUPER: DAY 118
Tommy rolls down the window, excited.

Road trip!

TOMMY

Greg is noticeably less enthusiastic. 

TOMMY

San Francisco here we come. Like the old 
times. 

Tommy notices Greg’s attitude.

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 89

TOMMY

What’s the matter, you don’t seem 
excited?

Let’s just finish this thing.

GREG

INT VAN - DAY
Greg rides with Tommy and a 3-MAN CREW we’ve never seen. 

Who are these guys? 

GREG

Tommy motions to TODD (20, green, fresh out of film 
school). 

TOMMY

That’s Todd. That’s... friend of Todd. 
And that’s... other friend of Todd.

Greg is confused by this.

Where’s Sandy?

GREG

Tommy doesn’t want to answer.

GREG
Where’s Rafael? 

It’s over for those guys.

TOMMY

GREG
You fired them?!

Tommy looks away. 

TOMMY
Ah forget about them. We don’t need them, 
we have Todds now.

Greg just shakes his head. What can he do?

So where are we going anyway...?

GREG

And now a big smile forms on Tommy’s face. Greg does NOT 
like the look of that. 

TOMMY
San Francisco baby!

Oh Christ.

GREG

CUT TO:

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 90

INT VAN - SAME
LATER. Driving on the 405 North. Tommy and Greg in the 
back. Greg doesn’t engage, just stares out the window.  

TOMMY

Somebody is sad today. Can you smile 
little bit or is it end of the world?

A beat. Greg doesn’t want to talk about it with Tommy.

Is this about your lady friend?

TOMMY

I don’t want to talk about it.    

GREG

But then a beat later.

GREG

We’ve hit a rough patch, I guess. I don’t 
know. Maybe we just want different 
things... 

That’s too bad. I always like her...

TOMMY

A beat.

TOMMY

I have idea! Let’s do a whole scene in 
San Francisco. 

GREG
What, a new scene?
TOMMY

We can use this emotion!

GREG

I thought we were just shooting 
exteriors.

Tommy excitedly grabs his LAPTOP and opens it.  

TOMMY

Don’t worry about this. 
So maybe we’re in coffee shop. Johnny and 
Mark talking about life and women. 

(beat, starts to type)

EXT FISHERMAN’S WHARF - EARLY MORNING
Packed with tourists and pricey real estate. 

We made it.

TODD (O.C.)

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 91

INT VAN - SAME
The van pulls up in front of a huge building. Greg looks 
closer and sees a small sign above the entrance. It reads 
“STREET FASHIONS USA.” Greg look at Tommy, shocked. 

Do you own this building?

GREG

EXT SAN FRANCISCO STREET - LATER
The crew is walking back to the van.

The bridges, Alcatraz...

TOMMY

We got everything. The whole city. 

TODD

Todd and his Assistant are about to hop in. Greg stops 
Tommy. 

GREG

I don’t understand. If you own this 
building, why didn’t we just shoot here?

TOMMY

(beat)

Script called for green screen.

Which makes absolutely no sense. Greg is about to say so 
when Tommy’s eyes fall on a FLOWER SHOP. 

TOMMY
I have new idea! 

Tommy crosses the street, oncoming traffic be damned. 
Todd looks at his TWO ASSISTANTS. They shrug and follow. 

EXT FLOWER SHOP - LATER
Scene over, Tommy comes back out on the sidewalk, 
excited.

Maybe now we shoot scene at the zoo... 

TOMMY

He walks ahead of Todd and his crew. Greg hangs back with 
them. He hears:

TODD’S ASSISTANT

It’s almost like he doesn’t want to 
finish the thing.
TODD

Well of course he doesn’t. When this 
movie ends, what’s he gonna do with 
himself? 

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 92

Greg absorbs that. On his face, as it lingers, CUT TO:

EXT POLO GROUNDS - ANOTHER DAY
The exact spot they played football years ago. Greg knows 
it too. He look at Tommy, wondering the point of all 
this. 

TOMMY

Now we throw the ball around. Like first 
time.

He shows Todd where to set up the camera. Then he throws 
the football towards Greg. It bounces in the dirt before 
him.

GREG

(picks up the ball)

Tommy, what are we doing here?

He tosses the ball back but Tommy drops it. Tommy picks 
it up with a new idea. 

Let’s do singing scene. 

TOMMY

What?

GREG

TOMMY

Mark wants to sing the “Kokomo” but he’s 
afraid. So Johnny help him. 

Yeah I don’t think so...

GREG

Tell the story of your Dad. 

TOMMY

Greg realizes Tommy is serious. 

I’m not doing that, Tommy.

GREG

TOMMY

I must insist. Daddy thinks you embarrass 
him, no one believes in you, you’re not 
good enough -- 

Greg quickly looks towards Todd, sees the camera is 
rolling.

GREG

Come on, man, I told you that in 
confidence. I told you that as a friend. 

Greg throws the ball back to Tommy who drops it. 

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 93

TOMMY

Movies are emotion. You need to be real 
for us. 

Fuck you Tommy, no --

GREG

TOMMY

Daddy hates you, Mommy thinks you’re a 
loser... 

I said NO! 

GREG

Greg hurls the ball at Tommy. Hard. 

TOMMY

Dammit Greg, why you throw this tricky 
stuff?!

GREG

You want to be real for the camera, fine. 
Tell me where you were born...

Tommy quickly looks at Todd, still filming. Then back to 
Greg.

This is not part of scene.

TOMMY

Tommy throws the ball back. His discomfort visibly 
growing.

Where are you from, Tommy?

GREG

I told you we don’t talk about this.

TOMMY

GREG

You want an easier one? Ok...
Where’s the money come from? 

(beat)

Now Tommy is getting angry.
GREG

You don’t go from selling toy birds to 
owning real estate on Lombard Street? 
How’d you get so much money, huh? What 
did you do?

Tommy throws the ball back, hoping the camera can’t tell 
how angry he’s becoming. 

GREG

Too personal. Ok. Forget that. Just tell 
me this: 
How old are you? 

(beat)

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 94

TOMMY
(a warning)

Greg...

GREG

You want to be real, let’s be real. What 
year were you born? Cause there’s no 
fucking way you’re in your --

And now Tommy EXPLODES, running over to Greg and leaping 
on top of him. Fists and kicks start flying, curses too, 
as they roll around in the grass. Todd and the crew keep 
filming. 

GREG

I believed in you. I trusted you. And for 
what? 

Eventually Greg shoves Tommy off of him and gets up. 
Looks down at him, hurt and angry.

I gave you everything!

TOMMY

You RUINED everything!

GREG

Greg shakes his head. Starts walking. Tommy calls out to 
him.

Greg!

TOMMY

Greg ignores him. Keeps walking.

YOU OWE ME YOUR LIFE!

TOMMY

I don’t owe you shit anymore.

GREG

Greg walks off. Nothing left between them now. He mutters 
to himself. 

And this movie better be awesome...

GREG

And with that he’s gone. Todd looks at Tommy still on the 
ground, emotionally spent. A beat:

Can we cut?

TODD

Tommy looks over to him. He forgot the camera was rolling 
still. And with that, principal photography on “The Room” 
is over.

CUT TO:

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 95

INT POST-PRODUCTION FACILITY - EDITING SUITE 
Greg sits with a gleeful Sandy and an exasperated ERICA 
CHASE, editor of “The Room.” We HEAR but don’t SEE what 
they’re watching. 

"MARK" (O.S.)
(suddenly explodes)

"Leave your stupid comments in your 
pocket!"

Greg is confused by what he’s seeing.

I don’t understand...

GREG

ERICA

Because it doesn’t make sense. Lisa says 
she's "getting ready for the party 
tonight." Then it's night and there's no 
party. Then it's day and she's still 
getting ready for the party! 

And that’s how Tommy wants it.

SANDY

Greg looks at him. What? Sandy shrugs. Typical Tommy.

So is it terrible or just confusing...?

GREG

Erica looks at Sandy.

SANDY

As crazy as the last 6 months have been, 
and as much as I want to strangle Tommy - 
this still isn't the worst movie I've 
ever made.

EXT HIGHLAND AVENUE - DAY
Greg drives up the street. On the phone with a New Agent:

NEW AGENT (OVER)

You’re telling me you worked on this 
thing for eight months and got nothing to 
show for it?

GREG

Believe me, we’ll be much better off if 
no one ever --

Greg’s eyes notice a giant BILLBOARD in the Hollywood 
skyline. To his utter shock, it’s an AD for THE ROOM: 

Oh fuck.

GREG

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 96

NEW AGENT (OVER)

Greg?

I’ll call you back.

GREG

Greg pulls over to the side. He gets a better look at the 
billboard. It’s one of TOMMY’S HEADSHOTS, his lips 
pursed, his eyes droopy, his whole face angled low as if 
looking down on the passing commuters. The tag line 
reads: “CAN YOU REALLY TRUST ANYONE?”
At the bottom of the billboard is an RSVP HOTLINE. 
Greg, curious, takes out his CELL, types in the number.

INT HOLLYWOOD APARTMENT - SAME
Tommy sits at a desk in a wife-beater. He answers 
excitedly:

I’m listening...

TOMMY

INT GREG’S CAR - SAME
Greg quickly hangs up. Disbelief.  

INT HOLLYWOOD APARTMENT - SAME

Hello? Hello?

TOMMY

No one is there. Tommy deflates. He hangs up the phone. 
We see his place has been turned into the de facto 
operation for all things “Room” publicity. Posters, 
fliers, stickers, etc. 
We stay with him a beat. This is his whole life now. With 
no one else in it. He continues what he was doing which 
is inserting professional-looking INVITATIONS into 
ENVELOPES. 

CUT TO:

INT LOBBY - GREG’S NEW APARTMENT - SAME
Greg opens the mailbox downstairs at his new place. He’s 
got a stack of bills. One POSTCARD stands out in 
particular.
ANGLE on the POSTCARD - “You & a Guest are Invited.” It’s 
an invite to The Room Premiere - below which is a faux 
review: “With the passion of Tenesse Willaims!”(sic) - 
Entertainment Today.

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 97

Greg looks at it. A beat. He throws it in the trash.

CUT TO:

INT COMMUNITY THEATER - DAY
Greg in a scene from Arthur Miller’s “Death of a 
Salesman.” A smattering of people in the audience. Greg 
tries not to be intimidated. 
"BIFF"

"No! Nobody's hanging himself, Willy! I 
ran down eleven flights with a pen in my 
hand today. And suddenly I stopped, you 
hear me? And in the middle of that office 
building, do you hear this? I stopped in 
the middle of that building and I saw - 
the sky. I saw the things that I love in 
this world. The work and the food and 
time to sit and smoke. And I looked at 
the pen and said to myself, what the hell 
am I grabbing this for? Why am I trying 
to become what I don't want to be? What 
am I doing in an office, making a 
contemptuous, begging fool of myself, 
when all I want is out there, waiting for 
me the minute I say I know who I am! Why 
can't I say that, Willy?"

He’s doing his best. And he’s not afraid. 

EXT COMMUNITY THEATER - LATER
Greg emerges, says goodbye to some of his fellow 
performers, is about to walk to his car when he hears:

Babyface.

TOMMY (O.S.)

Greg turns. None too pleased to see Tommy. 

You stalking me now?

GREG

You’re not so hard to find. 

TOMMY

Behind Greg is a poster advertising the play - “Death of 
a Salesman” starring William Devane and Greg Sestero, 
their head shots prominently featured. 

Did you watch the play?

GREG

Nah. You know I don’t like comedies. 

TOMMY

Greg just shakes his head.

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 98

So how’s Amber?

TOMMY

GREG

I don’t know. 
She moved to Austin. It didn’t work out.

(off Tommy’s surprise)

I’m sorry to hear this.

TOMMY

That why you’re here?

GREG

TOMMY

No...
You didn’t RSVP. To the premiere. 

(beat)

Yeah, I don’t think I can make it. Sorry.

GREG

Tommy says nothing. Greg is about to walk away. He turns 
back to Tommy. 

GREG

Are you sure you even want to do that? I 
mean, maybe it’s best to just... bury the 
thing.

Why would you say this?

TOMMY

I’ve seen some clips...

GREG

TOMMY

Oh you don’t know what you saw. I fire 
three editors since then... 

Greg shakes his head. Of course he did. He starts to walk 
off but Tommy stops him. 

TOMMY

We made a pact, remember. To never lose 
sight of our dreams. And Friday night 
they’re premiering a movie - our movie - 
in a real live movie theatre...

Greg takes that in. In that respect Tommy makes a good 
point. But still, he’s hesitant. 

TOMMY

I know you don’t like me anymore. So 
don’t do this for me. Do it for you. 
You’ll finally get to see yourself on the 
big screen. 
(beat)
This was your dream too, Greg. 

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 99

And with that Tommy turns and walks away. CUT TO:

EXT GREG’S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Greg stands in the very same TUXEDO he wore in the film. 
There’s a strange vibe in the air. Maybe not excitement, 
exactly, but some charge of anticipation, energy.
After a beat, a LIMOUSINE pulls up outside his place. 
There’s no mistaking its destination - “ROOM” POSTERS 
have been taped on the doors. One of the doors opens and 
out pops Tommy.
He gives Greg a big, exuberant bear hug. Greg doesn’t 
return it. His guard still up. 

Can you believe this? 

TOMMY

Greg sighs. Part of him can’t believe he’s doing this. 
As they hop in, Tommy hands Greg a “Room” POSTCARD. Greg 
looks it over, doesn’t want it. Tries to hand it back.

It’s ok. I have boxes of these things. 

TOMMY

INT LIMOUSINE - SAME
And Tommy meant that literally. He and Greg sit amongst 
various boxes of Room propaganda. 

GREG

You really pulled out all the stops 
tonight.

TOMMY
Wait till you see. 
Oh. And I have surprise for you.

(beat)

That’s worrisome. CUT TO:

EXT HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD - MOMENTS LATER
The limo driving down the street. It slows in front of 
Grauman’s Chinese Theatre where a CROWD of people have 
gathered to see “The Matrix: Reloaded.” 
They turn to see Tommy, popping out of the sunroof. With 
his strange voice and dark sunglasses, he could be a 
villain from that movie. He yells to the crowd.

TOMMY

Don’t see that! Come see feature movie 
premiere! Tonight: The Room! You’re all 
invited!

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 100

Tommy starts throwing T-shirts and Postcards to the 
crowd. And to anyone else on Hollywood Boulevard who have 
no idea what to make of this crazy guy. 

TOMMY

(to the DRIVER)

Ok, let’s go!

EXT LAEMMLE FAIRFAX - SAME
Spotlights. Red carpet. Velvet ropes. Fanfare. Exactly 
what you’d expect at a big studio movie premiere. 
Except not a lot of people waiting outside. “Chris-R” is 
there with “Denny” and “Mike.” Juliette and Robyn stand 
with Carolyn Minnott and her Salt of the Earth elderly 
HUSBAND. 
The limo pulls up in front. Tommy’s HIRED PHOTOGRAPHERS 
begin to snap pictures in expectation of Tommy’s exit. 

INT LIMOUSINE - SAME
Greg is about to open the door when a look comes over 
Tommy. 

TOMMY

(to the Driver)

Drive around the block again.
The Driver shoots him a confused look. 

We need to build the anticipation.

TOMMY

Greg rolls his eyes. Typical Wiseau.

EXT LAEMMLE FAIRFAX - SAME
The gathered guests are confused as the limo pulls away. 

INT LIMOUSINE - SAME
It pulls up again. Tommy looks out the window. Still not 
satisfied. They keep driving. 

EXT LAEMMLE FAIRFAX - SAME
Watching the limo drive off again, Robyn announces:

Tommy Wiseau, ladies and gentlemen.

ROBYN

Which gets a big laugh from the Room-mates.

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 101

After a few more beats, the limo pulls up again and this 
time it stops. The Photographers look at one another, 
shrug, start taking pictures. 

INT LIMOUSINE - SAME
Tommy nods to Greg. It’s time. The door opens. 

EXT LAEMMLE FAIRFAX - SAME
Greg emerges first. Everyone cheers and shouts for him. 
And, hearing the cheers and shouts, Tommy quickly follows 
after. He’s ecstatic to hear the cheers increase in 
volume.

Hello everybody!

TOMMY

Tommy enthusiastically enters the theatre. Greg a lot 
less so. He’s curious, sure, but he already can’t wait 
for this to be over. 

INT LAEMMLE FAIRFAX - SAME
People have started taking their seats. The MIDDLE ROWS 
have all been reserved for the CAST. Tommy waves to 
anyone and everyone and takes an aisle seat. It’s 
starting to dawn on Tommy - this is real, people are 
about to watch his movie - and it’s beginning to make him 
nervous.
Greg sits next to him. No idea really what to expect. The 
lights dim. 
A LAEMMLE EMPLOYEE steps up to the front, holding a 
microphone. 

If I can have your attention... 

LAEMMLE EMPLOYEE

ANGLE on “Denny,” turning to give Tommy a big thumbs. It 
doesn’t appear to calm Tommy’s nerves.

LAEMMLE EMPLOYEE

Please welcome the writer/ director/ 
producer/ and star of tonight’s...
... “extravaganza.” Mr. Tommy Wizz, Wise, 
Wisso?

(looking at his notes)

Tommy stands amongst the cheers and catcalls of his 
guests. He now looks fucking terrified. Sweat pours down 
face and neck. His hands shake as he grabs the mic. He 
looks out on the crowd - Juliette, Carolyn, Robyn, Sandy, 
the whole cast. 

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 102

He looks at Greg. A long, long look at Greg. And then, 
fighting back, tears, finally he speaks:

TOMMY

This is my movie. This is my life. 
I hope you learn something... And 
discover yourself. 

(beat)

He makes the “hang-loose” sign above his head.

Be cool.

TOMMY

And with that, he walks back to his seat. Greg puts his 
hand on Tommy’s shoulder and squeezes. No matter what the 
movie is, Greg is legitimately proud of Tommy at this 
moment. Tommy puts his hand on Greg’s hand in a gesture 
of thanks. 

I’m happy you’re here. 

TOMMY

Greg nods. Not giving Tommy anything more than that. 
The lights go down and everyone claps - the movie is 
about to begin. 
ANGLE ON THE SCREEN: the LOGO for Wiseau Films. It gets 
the requisite applause. Tommy raises his arms in the air. 
His shining moment. 
And then comes a SECOND LOGO for Wiseau Films. This is 
met with confusion, mostly. Sandy rolls his eyes. Then 
some polite applause. 
And now comes the opening credits. Dramatic music over 
random shots of San Francisco. More loud applause. Greg 
just shakes his head - “wait.”
CREDITS END  

“THE ROOM”
And out comes Tommy as “Johnny.” Here are his first 
lines:

“JOHNNY”

“Hi babe!”
“I have something for youuu.” 

(singsong)

“What is it?!”

“LISA”

“Lisa” excitedly tries to wrestle it from behind 
“Johnny’s” back. Eventually he gives it to her. A box. 
She opens it to reveal “sexy red lingerie.” 

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 103

ANGLE ON Greg, mortified.
BACK ON SCREEN: “Lisa” re-enters the room in the 
lingerie. “Johnny” likes what he sees.

“JOHNNY”
“Wow you look so sexy, Lisa. I would do 
anything for my girl.”

At which point, “Denny” enters the room. This is 
apparently not weird at all. 

“Oh hi Denny.”

“JOHNNY”

“DENNY”

(inappropriately ogling)

“Wow look at you!”

“Anything for my princess.”

“JOHNNY”

ANGLE ON Philip Haldiman. He just shrugs.
BACK ON SCREEN: 

“THE ROOM”
“Denny” eats his apple downstairs while, upstairs, “Lisa” 
and “Johnny” begin their foreplay. A few beats of this 
and then “Denny,” surprising them both, joins in on the 
fun!
ANGLE ON Amber. She looks at Greg. Wow. He doesn’t return 
her gaze.
BACK ON SCREEN: 

“Denny, two’s great. But threes a crowd.” 

“JOHNNY”

Denny gets the message. 

“Bye Denny.”

“JOHNNY”

And Denny leaves. The music changes to what Tommy thinks 
is sultry and arousing. “Johnny” and “Lisa” begin to make 
out.
ANGLE ON Juliette, hiding her face. Robyn puts her arm 
around her. Enjoying themselves, not yet demoralized. 
BACK ON SCREEN: 

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 104

“THE ROOM”
“Johnny” has sex with “Lisa” as only he can. In her belly 
button. 
ANGLE ON the Audience. Many now start trading crazy looks 
like “what the hell are we watching?” Many others 
fidgeting in their chairs. You can feel it growing. 
Greg is obviously slinking down in his chair from 
embarrassment. 

CUT TO:

ANGLE ON SCREEN 

“THE ROOM” INT FLOWER SHOP
“Johnny” enters a Flower Shop. 
FLORIST

“Can I help you?”

“Yeah can I have a dozen red roses?”

“JOHNNY”

FLORIST

“Oh hi Johnny. I didn’t know it was you. 
Here you go.”

“It’s me. How much is it?”

“JOHNNY”

FLORIST

“It’ll be 18 dollars.”
“JOHNNY”
(he pets a DOG)

“Here you go. Keep the change.”
“Hi doggie!”

“Thanks. You’re my favorite customer.” 

FLORIST

ANGLE ON the Audience. Uncomfortable fidgeting, several 
members trying desperately not to laugh out loud. 
Meanwhile, Tommy watches intently. Still reveling in his 
masterpiece.
BACK ON SCREEN

“THE ROOM”
Lisa’s Mom “Claudette” across from “Lisa.”

“Nobody wants to help me. And I’m dying.”

“CLAUDETTE”

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 105

“LISA”
“You’re not dying.”

“CLAUDETTE”

“I got the results of the tests back. I 
definitely have breast cancer.”

ANGLE ON Carolyn and her HUSBAND. He squeezes her hand, 
proud. 
ANGLE ON SCREEN. 

“THE ROOM”
And the movie’s most famous scene. “Johnny” and “Lisa” 
having it out. 

“I could not go on without you Lisa.”

“JOHNNY”

“LISA”
“You’re scaring me.”
“JOHNNY”

“I did not hit you. You’re lying!”

He takes a deep breath and, in his best James Dean 
impression, shouts to the heavens:

“YOU’RE TEARING ME APART LISA!”

“JOHNNY”

ANGLE on the Audience. The tittering a little louder now. 
A few audience members now outwardly laughing...

CUT TO:

ANGLE ON SCREEN

“THE ROOM”
“Chris-R” threatens to kill “Denny” before “Johnny” and 
“Mark” show up to rescue him. And then, just as quickly, 
“Lisa” and “Claudette” are there too.

“I owe him some money.”

“DENNY”

“What kind of money?”

“LISA”

ANGLE ON ROBYN, she laughs out loud at this line.

“What do you need money for?”

“CLAUDETTE”

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 106

“LISA”
(to Her Mom)

“Mom please! Denny is with me and 
Johnny.”

Which gets more laughs from the crowd. The laughs are 
growing in volume. Audience members getting more and more 
comfortable laughing at this piece of shit. Even Juliette 
is now enjoying herself. 
ANGLE ON Greg, not expecting this. He too looks like he 
might join in the fun. But he turns towards Tommy --
ANGLE ON TOMMY, starting to realize this isn’t turning 
out how he expected.  Greg sees it on Tommy’s face - it’s 
like he’s been punched in the gut. 
This is not good...
ANGLE ON SCREEN  

“THE ROOM”
“Johnny” and “Mark” on the rooftop. We saw this one being 
filmed earlier but cut together, it’s even more 
incredible.

“JOHNNY”

“It’s not true. I did not hit her. It’s 
bullshit. I did not hit her. I did 
naaht.”
(beat)
“Oh hi Mark.”

Everyone has by now lost their collective shit. They hoot 
and holler, genuinely having fun at the ridiculousness. 
Tommy is seemingly the only silent person in the theatre.
ANGLE ON Greg, still looking at Tommy. What was supposed 
to be the best night of his life has turned into maybe 
the worst. Tommy stares straight ahead. The laughter like 
daggers. 

CUT TO:

ANGLE ON SCREEN 

“THE ROOM”
The big clean shaven reveal. Greg comes through the door. 

“MARK”
“So... you like it?”
“JOHNNY”

“You look like a babyface!”

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 107

ANGLE on Greg in the audience, remembering this moment 
and all that came after. And then BACK ON SCREEN:

“You guys wanna play football?”

“DENNY”

“Sure./Great.”

“EVERYONE”

“PETER”
“I don’t think so.”
TOMMY

“Come on... Don’t be chicken. Cheep cheep 
cheep cheep.”
And everyone joins in...

“Cheep cheep cheep cheep.”

“EVERYONE”

All of which is met with loud laughter and big applause. 
Tommy looks to be on the verge of tears. It’s 
heartbreaking. He can’t take anymore. He stands and walks 
out, not wanting anyone to see him lose it.
Greg sees this. And yeah he’s definitely still harboring 
that ill will towards Tommy but, fuck man, nobody 
deserves this. He decides to go after him. 

CUT TO:

INT MOVIE THEATRE - LOBBY - SAME
Tommy has to lean against a wall to keep from falling 
apart. Greg comes out and sees him. 

They hate it.

TOMMY

No, Tommy, they’re...

GREG

Greg doesn’t really know what to say.

They’re just laughing. 

GREG

They’re laughing at me.  

TOMMY

Tommy starts to get emotional.

TOMMY
Maybe everyone right, Greg. Maybe it’s 
true. I am a joke.
GREG

Tommy...

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 108

Tommy is lower than Greg or any of us have ever seen to 
this point. It breaks Greg’s heart. 

GREG

Hey, listen to me. That thing up there. 
That’s your MOVIE, man. You made it - YOU 
- all by yourself. Do you know how 
special that is? It’s incredible. How 
many people get to say they did something 
like that? 

Tommy is starting to slowly come around to Greg’s point 
of view. 

GREG

And, yeah, ok, maybe it didn’t turn out 
exactly as you hoped. But listen for a 
second. Do you hear that? Come with me...

Greg pulls Tommy back towards the entrance. He opens the 
door. They walk back in:

INT. MOVIE THEATRE - SAME
Standing in the back, Tommy and Greg witness:
ANGLE ON THE AUDIENCE, everyone is still laughing, in 
fact it’s louder now. People going crazy.

GREG

Look how much fun they’re having. They’re 
fucking loving it, Tommy. This is what 
it’s all about.  

Tommy is still conflicted. But maybe Greg makes a good 
point. 

GREG

How many times you think Hitchcock got 
this kind of response?

Never. 

TOMMY

That’s right. But you did.

GREG

And now Tommy is really coming around. Greg reaches out, 
touches Tommy on the shoulder. A gesture that surprises 
Tommy. He looks up at Greg, his old friend. Greg looks at 
him with respect and admiration. With love for his friend 
again. They stand there and watch:
ANGLE ON SCREEN

THE DISASTER ARTIST - 109

“THE ROOM”
“Johnny” decides to commit suicide. But first he writhes 
on the ground, humps the RED DRESS, fumbles with the GUN, 
and, only then, puts it in his mouth and pulls the 
trigger. 

CUT TO:

GREG AND TOMMY
As the audience starts shouting “do it! Do it!” Greg 
looks at Tommy. He sees a small smile cross his face. And 
he knows - he’s gotten through to him. They can both 
enjoy this now. 

CUT TO:

ANGLE ON SCREEN
“Johnny” lying there dead - with “Denny” and “Lisa” now 
also “Mark” again hovering above him - the final FADE OUT 
is met with STUNNED SILENCE. 
ANGLE ON GREG AND TOMMY
A beat between them. Neither one sure how the audience 
will react now. 
And then RAPTUROUS APPLAUSE. 
Tommy looks at Greg. Takes off his sunglasses. A big 
smile on his face now. All around him, everyone is 
standing, cheering, applauding his movie.
People seem legitimately enthusiastic about “The Room.”
His dream come true - if not exactly as he intended. He 
nods to Greg. Greg nods back. Friends again.
And then, in an instant, he starts jogging up to the 
front, his arms raised over his head in triumph. The 
adulation only grows as he’s handed a microphone, heads 
up to the stage. 

TOMMY

So I’m glad you liked my... comedic 
movie!

Everyone applauds. Greg laughs to himself at that.

TOMMY

As everybody know, I make this movie 
completely by myself. People say “Tommy 
you crazy” but I say “yeah so what? My 
vision, my money, you must believe in 
yourself.

A beat. And Tommy grows somber.

TOMMY

I must be honest. There were times when 
maybe I didn’t believe. But I have friend 
- I have best friend. And he believe in 
me.

Tommy looks at Greg. A nice moment .

TOMMY

This movie never happen without my best 
friend Greg. Come on up, Babyface!

Greg smiles, a little embarrassed but also appreciative. 
He walks up on stage. Gives Tommy a hug.
Tommy steps aside. Lets Greg bask in the spotlight, the 
audience cheering him loudly. After a beat, Tommy joins 
him. Leans into the mic:

Now who’s ready for after party?!

TOMMY
