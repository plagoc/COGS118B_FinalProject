INT. WELTON ACADEMY HALLWAY - DAY

A young boy, dressed in a school uniform and cap, fidgets as his mother
adjusts his tie.

 
 

 
 

 
Now remember, keep your shoulders back.

MOTHER

 

A student opens up a case and removes a set of bagpipes. The young
boy and his brother line up for a photograph

 
 
 

 
 
 

 

 
Okay, put your arm around your brother.
That's it. And breathe in.

PHOTOGRAPHER

The young boy blinks as the flash goes off.

 
 

 
 

 
Okay, one more.

 

PHOTOGRAPHR

An old man lights a single candle. A teacher goes over the old
man's duties.

 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 

 

TEACHER

 
Now just to review, you're going to
follow along the procession until you
get to the headmaster. At that point
he will indicate to you to light the
candles of the boys.

 
All right boys, let's settle down.

MAN

 

The various boys, including NEIL, KNOX, and CAMERON, line up holding
banners. Ahead of them is the old man, followed by the boy with the
bagpipes with the two youngest boys at the front.

 
 

 
 

 
Banners up.

 

MAN

The boys hoist the banners and the bagpipes begin to play loudly. The
small group marches out of the room and down a set of stairs into a
church. The pews are filled with students and parents while the
teachers, all dressed in robes, are seated at the front of the church
behind the headmaster.

The boys break off to either side at the front of the church. The
bagpipes cease and the headmaster, MR. NOLAN, walks over to the old
man carrying the candle.

 
 
 

 
 
 

 

 
Ladies and gentlemen, boys, the light
of knowledge.

MR NOLAN

An organ begins to play as the old man goes forward with shaking hands
to the young boys in the front pew. Each boy is holding a candle and
he bends over to light the first one. Each boy in turn lights the
candle of the boy next to him.

 
 
 

 
 
 

 

 
One hundred years ago, in 1859, 41 boys sat in this
room and were asked the same question that greets

MR NOLAN

 
 

 
 

you at the start of each semester. Gentlemen, what
are the four pillars?

All throughout the pews, uniformed boys rise to their feet. TODD, who
is not wearing a uniform, is urged by his father to stand with them.

 
 

 
 

 
Tradition, honor, discipline, excellence.

BOYS

 

The boys quickly return to their seats.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 

MR NOLAN

 
In her first year, Welton Academy graduated five
students. Last year we graduated fifty-one. And
more than seventy-five percent of those went on to
the Ivy League. This, this kind of accomplishment is
the result of fervent dedication to the principles taught
here. This is why you parents have been sending us
your sons. This is why we are the best preparatory
school in the United States.

Mr. Nolan soaks up the applause from the audience.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 

MR NOLAN

 
As you know, our beloved Mr. Portius of the English
department retired last term. You will have the
opportunity later to meet his replacement, Mr. John
Keating, himself a graduate of this school. And who,
for the past several years, has been teaching at the
highly regarded Chester School in London.

The crowd applauds once again.

EXT. SCHOOL GROUNDS - DAY

The school lawn is a filled with luggage, students, and parents mulling
about in every direction.

INT CHURCH ENTRANCE - DAY

Mr Nolan stands by the entrance, speaking with each family as they leave.

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
MR NOLAN
Glad you could come by.

 

 
Thrilling ceremony as usual Dr. Nolan.

MR ANDERSON

 

 
You've been away too long.

MR NOLAN

 

 
Hello Dr. Nolan.

 

MRS ANDERSON

 
Good to have you back.

MR NOLAN

 

 
MRS ANDERSON
This is our youngest, Todd.

 

 
Mr. Anderson.You have some big shoes to fill,

MR NOLAN

 

 

 
 

 

 
 

young man. Your brother was one of our finest.

 
 
Thank you.

TODD

Todd and his parents leave while others file past Mr. Nolan.

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
Lovely ceremony.

 

WOMAN

 
Thank you. So glad you liked it.

MR NOLAN

 

MR PERRY approaches with his son Neil. He shakes Mr. Nolan's hand.

MR PERRY

MR NOLAN

 
Good to see you again.

MR PERRY

 

 
Hello Mr. Nolan.

 

NEIL

 
Neil. We expect great things from you this year.

MR NOLAN

 

 
Thank you, sir.

 

NEIL

 
Well he won't disappoint us. Right Neil?

MR PERRY

 

 
NEIL
I'll do my best sir.

 

EXT SCHOOL GROUNDS - DAY

A bell tolls. Parents begin wishing their boys farewell.

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
Hey, come on son.

 

FATHER

 
Chin up.

 

 
No tears now.

 

 
Okay.

 

 
Chin up.

 

MOTHER

Another boy hugs his mother.

 
 

 
 

 
I don't want to go here.

BOY

 

 
 

 
 

 
You be a good boy and do your lessons.

MOTHER

 

EXT SCHOOL GROUNDS - DAY

Neil emerges from a building and sees Todd.

 
 

 
 

 
Hey, I hear we're gonna be roommates.

NEIL

 

He shakes Todd's hand.

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
I'm Neil Perry.

 

NEIL

 
Todd Anderson.

 

TODD

 
Why'd you leave Balincrest?

NEIL

 

 
TODD
My brother went here.

 

 
Oh, so you're that Anderson.

NEIL

 

INT DORMATORY - DAY

DR. HAGER is standing in his room doorway while SPAZ and his father are
going over some last minute precautions over the boy's allergies. Spaz's
father hands Hager various bottles.

 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 

 

FATHER

 
This is for sinuses. Oh, and if he can't swallow you
give him one of these. And if he had trouble breathing
you can give him some of those.

 
All right fine.

 

HAGER

Dr. Hager takes the bottles and quickly backs into his room, shutting
the door.

 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 
Did you remember your vaporizer?

 
    (to son)

FATHER

 
Yes, I put it in my room.

SPAZ

 

Spaz's father tries to say something else to Dr. Hager but realizes he
has already gone.

INT HALLWAY - DAY

Neil pushes his way through a crowd of boys, carrying two suitcases. As
he enters his room, Knox quickly passes by.

 
 

 
 

 
Hey, how's it going Neil?

KNOX

 

 
 

 
 

 
 
Hey Knox.

NEIL

Cameron comes by and leans against the doorway.

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
Neil, study group tonight?

CAMERON

 

 
Yeah, sure.

 

NEIL

 

 
Business as usual, huh? Hey, I hear you got the new
kid. Looks like a stiff!

CAMERON

He begins laughing when he notices Todd coming into the room.

 
 

 
 

 
Oops!

 

CAMERON

Cameron quickly leaves. Neil tries to keep from laughing as Todd enters
the room and sets his luggage down on his bed.

 
 
 

 
 
 

 

 
Listen, don't mind Cameron. He was born with his
foot in his mouth. You know what I mean?

NEIL

He pulls some papers from his blazer pocket and playfully whacks Todd 
across the back with it.

CHARLIE comes to the door with a smug expression on his face. Knox and
MEEKS are close behind him. He points at Neil

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
Rumor has it, you did summer school.

CHARLIE

 

 

 
Yep. Chemistry. My father thought I should get ahead.
How was your summer Slick?

NEIL

 
Keen.

 

CHARLIE

The boys enter the room. Charlie turns around and looks at Meeks who is
just entering. 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
Meeks. Door. Closed.

CHARLIE

 

 
Yes sir.

 

MEEKS

 
Gentlemen, what are the four pillars?

NEIL

 

 
Travesty. Horror. Decadence. Excrement.

BOYS

 

Charlie makes himself comfortable on Neil's bed and lights up a cigarette.
Meanwhile, Todd is by his bed unpacking his luggage.

 
 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

CHARLIE

 
Okay, study group. Meeks aced Latin. I didn't quite
flunk English. So, if you want, we've got our study
group.

 

 
Sure. Cameron asked me too. Anyone mind
including him?

NEIL

 
Hmm, what's his specialty, boot-licking?

CHARLIE

 

 
Come on, he's your roommate.

NEIL

 

 
That's not my fault.

CHARLIE

 

Meeks seems to notice Todd for the first time.

 
 

 
 

 
Oh, I'm sorry, my name is Steven Meeks.

MEEKS

 

Neil quickly gets up from his spot by the window.

 
 

 
 

 
Oh, this is Todd Anderson.

NEIL

 

Todd turns around and shakes hands with Meeks.

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
Nice to meet you.

 

MEEKS

 
Nice to meet you.

 

TODD

 
Charlie Dalton.

 

CHARLIE

Charlie continues to lay on the bed, looking smug. Knox extends a hand.

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
Knox Overstreet.

 

KNOX

 
Todd's brother was Jeffrey Anderson.

NEIL

 

 
Oh yeah, sure. Valedictorian. National merit scholar. 

CHARLIE

 

 
Oh well, welcome to Hell-ton.

MEEKS

 

 

 
It's every bit as tough as they say, unless you're a
genius like Meeks.

CHARLIE

 
He flatters me. That's why I help him with Latin.

MEEKS

 

 
CHARLIE
And English, and Trig.

 

Charlie begins coughing. There is a knock at the door. Charlie quickly
stamps out his cigarette on the floor and Neil tries to wave the smoke
from the air.

 
 

 
 

 
 
It's open.

NEIL

The door opens and Mr. Perry walks into the room. Neil quickly rises from
the window.

 
 

 
 

 
Father, I thought you'd gone.

NEIL

 

The other boys stand up when he enters.

 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
Mr. Perry.

BOYS

 

MR PERRY

 
Keep your seats fellows, keep your seats. Neil, I've
just spoken to Mr. Nolan. I think that you're taking
too many extra curricular activities this semester, and
I've decided that you should drop the school annual.

 
But I'm the assistant editor this year.

NEIL

 

 
Well I'm sorry Neil.

 

MR PERRY

 
But Father, I can't. It wouldn't be fair.

NEIL

 

 
Fellas, would you excuse us for a moment?

MR PERRY

 

Mr. Perry walks towards the door and Neil hesitantly follows. Mr. Perry
pauses by the door and smiles to the other boys.

INT. HALLWAY - DAY

The smile has gone from Mr. Perry's face. He grabs a hold of Neil's arm.

 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 

 
Don't you ever dispute me in public. Do you
understand?

MR PERRY

 
Father, I wasn't disputing-

NEIL

 

 

 

 
After you've finished medical school and you're on your own, then you
can do as you damn well please. But until then, you do as I tell you.
Is that clear?

MR PERRY

 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
NEIL
Yes sir. I'm sorry.

 

 

 
You know how much this means to your mother,
don't you?

MR PERRY

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
Yes sir. You know me, always taking on too much.

NEIL

 

 

 
Well, that's my boy. Now listen, you need anything,
you let us know, huh?

MR PERRY

 
Yes sir.

 

NEIL

Mr. Perry slaps his son on the shoulder and leaves. Neil leans his head
back against the wall as the other boys emerge from the room.

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
Why doesn't he let you do what you want?

CHARLIE

 

 
Yeah Neil, tell him off. It couldn't get any worse.

KNOX

 

 

 
Oh, that's rich. Like you guys tell your parents off, Mr.
Future Lawyer and Mr. Future Banker.

NEIL

 
Okay, so I don't like it any more than you do.

CHARLIE

 

 

 
Well just don't tell me how to talk to my father. You
guys are the same way.

NEIL

 
All right, all right, Jesus. So what are you going to do?

KNOX

 

 
What I have to do. Drop the annual.

NEIL

 

 

 
Well I wouldn't lose much sleep over it. It's just a
bunch of jerks trying to impress Nolan.

CHARLIE

 
I don't care. I don't give a damn about any of it.

NEIL

 

 
Well, uh, Latin, eight o' clock in my room?

MEEKS

 

 
Yes.

 

NEIL

 
Todd, you're welcome to join us.

MEEKS

 

 
KNOX
Yeah, come along pal.

 

Todd looks up from his desk where he is setting his alarm clock.

 
 

 
 

 
Thanks.

 

TODD

EXT. FIELDS - DAY

A clock bell chimes five o'clock. Enormous flocks of birds, apparently
disturbed by the noise, take to the sky.

INT. STAIRCASE - DAY

The sound of squawking birds merges into the sound of noisy boys as they
descend the stairs in a long spiralling line.

MR. MCALLISTER tries to make it upstairs against the steady stream.

 
 
 

 
 
 

 

 
Slow down boys, slow down you horrible
phalanx of pubescense.

MCALLISTER

INT CHEMISTRY LAB - DAY

A teacher walks up and down the aisles, handing out books.

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 

TEACHER

 
Pick three laboratory experiments from
the project list and report on them every
five weeks. The first twenty questions at
the end of chapter one are due tomorrow.

The students let out a collective groan.

INT. LATIN CLASSROOM - DAY

Mr. McAllister paces back and forth in front of the blackboard and gets
the students to repeat everything he says.

 
 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 

MCALLISTER

 
    (students repeat after each word.)

 
 
Agricolam. Agricola. Agricolae.
Agricolarum. Agricolis. Agricolas.
Agrilcolis.

Again, please.
Agricola.

INT. MATH CLASSROOM - DAY

Dr. Hager walks up the classroom aisles with his arms behind his back.

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 

HAGER

 
Your study of trigonometry requires absolute precision.
Anyone failing to turn in any homework assignment will
be penalized one point off their final grade. Let me urge
you now not to test me on this point.

INT. KEATING'S CLASSROOM - DAY

Students enter Keating's classroom, talking and acting up. Keating
glances out from his room off to one side.

 
 

 
 

 
Hey Spaz, Spaz.

 

KNOX

Spaz turns around in time to be hit by a ball of crumpled up paper
while Cameron smacks him on the shoulder.

 
 

 
 

 
Brain damage.

 

CAMERON

The students quickly quiet down as Keating emerges from the other room,
whistling the 1812 Overture. He walks up the length of the classroom and
out the door without a word. The students look around at one another,
uncertain of what to do. Keating pokes his head back in the doorway.

 
 

 
 

 
Well come on.

 

KEATING

He gestures them to follow and the students, after some hesitation, grab
their books and follow Keating out into the main entranceway. 

INT. ENTRANCEWAY - DAY

Keating stands before the school's trophy cabinets and waits until all
the boys arrive.

 
 
 

 
 
 

 

 
"Oh Captain, My Captain" who knows where
that comes from?

KEATING

Todd looks up as if he knows the answer, but says nothing. Spaz blows his
nose a little too close to Meeks for his liking.

 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 

 

KEATING

 
Not a clue? It's from a poem by Walt
Whitman about Mr. Abraham Lincoln. Now in
this class you can call me Mr. Keating. Or,
if you're slightly more daring, Oh Captain,
My Captain.

The students laugh slightly.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 

KEATING

 
Now let me dispel a few rumors so they
don't fester into facts. Yes, I too
attended Hell-ton and survived. And no,
at that time I was not the mental giant
you see before you. I was the intellectual
equivalent of a ninety-eight pound
weakling. I would go to the beach and
people would kick copies of Byron in my
face.

The boys laugh once again, while Cameron, obviously trying to write all
this down, looks around confusedly. Keating looks down at papers in his
hand.

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 

KEATING

 
Now, Mr… Pitts. That's a rather
unfortunate name. Mr. Pitts, where are
you?

Pitts raises his hand while everyone around him snickers.

 

 

 
Mr. Pitts, would you open your hymnal to page 542 and read the first
stanza of the poem you find there?

KEATING

 

 

 

 

 

PITTS

 

 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 

 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

"To the virgins, to make much of time"?

 

 
Yes, that's the one. Somewhat appropriate,
isn't it.

KEATING

 

PITTS

 
"Gather ye rosebuds while ye may, old
time is still a flying, and this same
flower that smiles today, tomorrow will
be dying."

 

KEATING

 
Thank you Mr. Pitts. "Gather ye rosebuds
while ye may." The Latin term for that
sentiment is Carpe Diem. Now who knows
what that means?

Meeks immediately puts his hand up.

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
Carpe Diem. That's "seize the day."

MEEKS

 

 
Very good, Mr.-

 

KEATING

 
Meeks.

 

MEEKS

 

KEATING

 
Meeks. Another unusual name. Seize the
day. Gather ye rosebuds while ye may.
Why does the writer use these lines?

CHARLIE
 
Because he's in a hurry.

 

 
 
No, ding!

KEATING

Keating slams his hand down on an imaginary buzzer.

 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 

 

KEATING

 
Thank you for playing anyway. Because we
are food for worms lads. Because, believe
it or not, each and every one of us in
this room is one day going to stop
breathing, turn cold, and die. 

Keating turns towards the trophy cases, filled with trophies, footballs,
and team pictures.

 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 

 

KEATING

 
Now I would like you to step forward over
here and peruse some of the faces from
the past. You've walked past them many
times. I don't think you've really looked
at them.

The students slowly gather round the cases and Keating moves behind them.

 

 

 

 

KEATING

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

They're not that different from you, are
they? Same haircuts. Full of hormones,
just like you. Invincible, just like you
feel. The world is their oyster. They
believe they're destined for great things,
just like many of you. Their eyes are full
of hope, just like you. Did they wait until
it was too late to make from their lives
even one iota of what they were capable?
Because you see gentlmen, these boys are
now fertilizing daffodils. But if you listen
real close, you can hear them whisper their
legacy to you. Go on, lean in.

The boys lean in and Keating hovers over Cameron's shoulder.

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
Carpe.

 
    (whispering in a gruff voice)

KEATING

Cameron looks over his shoulder with an aggravated expression on his face. 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 

KEATING

 
Hear it?
 
Carpe. Carpe Diem. Seize the day boys,
make your lives extraordinary.

    (whispering again)

The boys stare at the faces in the cabinet in silence.

EXT. SCHOOL STEPS - DAY

The boys emerge from the school, loaded down with numerous books.

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
That was weird.

 

PITTS

 
But different.

 

NEIL

 
KNOX
Spooky if you ask me.

 

 
Think he'll test us on that stuff?

CAMERON

 

 
Come on Cameron, don't you get anything?

CHARLIE

 

 
What? What?

 

CAMERON

INT. LOCKER ROOM - EVENING

A coach sticks his head around the corner into the room.

 
 
 

 
 
 

 

 
Let's go boys, hustle up in here. That
means you Dalton.

COACH

Meeks emerges from the showers, drying himself off.

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 
Okay, who's up for a trig study group
tonight guys?

MEEKS

 
Me.

 
Me.

 
 
What?

 

 

PITTS

NEIL

 
(still annoyed by what the coach said)

CHARLIE

 

 
I can't make it guys. I have to have
dinner at the Danburry's house.

KNOX

 
The Danburry's? Who are the Danburry's?

PITTS

 

 
Big alumns. How'd you swing that?

CAMERON

 

 

 
Friends of my Dad's. They're probably in
their nineties or something.

KNOX

 
Ooh!

 

CHARLIE

 
Anything's better than Hell-ton hash.

NEIL

 

 
I'll second that.

 

CHARLIE

 
Yeah we'll see.

 

KNOX

Neil approaches Todd, who's been sitting by the window staring down at the
floor. Neil snaps his fingers to get Todd's attention. 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
Hey, you coming to the study group tonight?

NEIL

 

 

 
Uh, no, no I, uh, I've got some history I
wanna do.

TODD

 
Suit yourself.

 

NEIL

INT. TODD'S ROOM - EVENING

Todd is seated at his desk. He scrawls "CARPE DIEM" across a blank page
of his notebook. He looks at it for a few moments before crumpling it up
and opening up his Chemistry book.

INT. ENTRANCEWAY - NIGHT

Hager comes down the stairs. Knox is looking at one of the old class photos

on the walls.

 
 

 
 

 
Ready Overstreet?

 

HAGER

Knox reluctantly follows after Dr. Hager.

 
 

 
 

 
Ready to go sir.

 

KNOX

EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

The car leaves Welton and drives towards the Danburry's house.

INT / EXT DANBURRY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

The doorbell rings.

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
Chet, can you get that?

 

MRS DANBURRY (O.S.)

 
I can't, Mom.

 

 
I'll get it.

 

CHET (O.S.)

CHRIS (O.S.)

The door opens and Knox is awe-struck by the beautiful girl (CHRIS) who
has answered the door.

 
 

 
 

 
Can I help you?

 

CHRIS

Knox manages to break out of his daze.

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
Hi. Knox Overstreet. Uh, Dr. Hager.

KNOX

 

 
Hi.

 

CHRIS

 
This is the Danburry's, right?

KNOX

 

 
Are you here to see Chet?

CHRIS

 

 
Mrs. Danburry?

 

KNOX

Chris begins to laugh as Mrs. Danburry arrives behind her.

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
No.

 

CHRIS

 

 
Sorry. Thank you Chris. I'm Mrs. Danburry.
You must be Knox.

MRS DANBURRY

 
Yes.

 

KNOX

 
 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
    (to Dr. Hager)

MRS DANBURRY

 
 
Back by nine.
 
Please come in.

    (to Knox)

 
Chris, come on, what are you doing?

CHET (O.S.)

 

 
Chet, I'm coming.

 

CHRIS

Knox enters the house, his mind still hung up on Chris as MR DANBURRY
comes out of the living room to meet him.

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
Knox. How are you? Joe Danburry.

MR DANBURRY

 

 
KNOX
Nice to meet you sir.

 

 

 
Well he's the spitting image of his father,
isn't he. How is he? Come on in.

MR DANBURRY

 
Chris!

 

CHET (O.S.)

 
He's great. He just did a big case for GM.

KNOX

 

 
I'm coming.

 

CHRIS (O.S.)

 

 
I know where you're headed, like father
like son, huh?

MR DANBURRY

INT. STUDENT LOUNGE - NIGHT

Several students are throwing darts at a small rubber skeleton hanging
from the bulletin board. Various students are studying and playing games.
Meeks and Pitts are sitting at one table working on their "hi-fi system".
Meeks is waving an antenna around with no luck. Pitts points out to him
that he forgot to plug it in. Neil, Cameron, and Charlie are working on
their trig homework.

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 
Just replace these numbers here with "x",
for "x" and "y".

CAMERON

 
 
Of course.

NEIL

 
Of course, so what's the problem?

CAMERON

 

Charlie enters the room and closes the door behind him, leaning up
against it heavily.

 
 

 
 

 
How was dinner?

 

CHARLIE

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
Huh?

 

KNOX

 
How was dinner?

 

CHARLIE

 
Terrible. Awful.

 

KNOX

He leaves the door and sits down with the other boys.

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
Why? What happened?

 

CHARLIE

 

 
Tonight, I met the most beautiful girl
in my entire life.

KNOX

 
Are you crazy? What's wrong with that?

NEIL

 

 
She's practically engaged. To Chet Danburry.

KNOX

 

 
That guy could eat a football.

CHARLIE

 

 
That's too bad.

 

PITTS

 

KNOX

 
Too bad? It's worse than too bad Pitsie,
it's a tragedy. A girl this beautiful in
love with such a jerk.

 

 
All the good ones go for jerks, you
know that.

PITTS

 

 
Ahh, forget her. Open your trig book and
try and figure out problem five.

CAMERON

 

 
I can't just forget her Cameron. And I
can't think about trig.

KNOX

The radio Meeks and Pitts were working on begins letting out a high
pitched hum.

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
We got it.

 
 
Holy cow.

PITTS

MEEKS

Mr. Hager walks into the room.

 
 
 

 
 
 

 

 
All right gentlemen, five minutes. Let's
go.

HAGER

The students quickly pack up their gear and prepare to leave. Pitts tries
to hide the radio in his lap. Charlie leans in close to Knox.

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

CHARLIE
 
Did you see her naked?

 

 
Very funny Dalton.

 

KNOX

 

 
That wouldn't be a radio in your lap,
would it Mr. Pitts?

HAGER

 
No sir. Science experiment, radar.

PITTS

 

Meeks holds up the antenna as if demonstrating it.

INT. KEATING'S CLASSROOM - DAY

Keating sits at his desk at the front of the classroom and opens up one
of his books.

 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 

KEATING

 
Gentlemen, open your text to page
twenty-one of the introduction. Mr.
Perry, will you read the opening
paragraph of the preface, entitled
"Understanding Poetry"?

 

NEIL

 
Understanding Poetry, by Dr. J. Evans
Pritchard, Ph.D. To fully understand
poetry, we must first be fluent with
its meter, rhyme, and figures of speech.
Then ask two questions: One, how artfully
has the objective of the poem been
rendered, and two, how important is that
objective. Question one rates the poem's
perfection, question two rates its
importance. And once these questions have
been answered, determining a poem's
greatest becomes a relatively simple
matter.

Keating gets up from his desk and prepares to draw on the chalk board.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 

NEIL

 
If the poem's score for perfection is
plotted along the horizontal of a graph,
and its importance is plotted on the
vertical, then calculating the total
area of the poem yields the measure of
its greatness.

Keating draws a corresponding graph on the board and the students
dutifully copy it down.

 
 
 

 
 
 

 

 
A sonnet by Byron may score high on the
vertical, but only average on the

NEIL

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

horizontal. A Shakespearean sonnet, on
the other hand, would score high both
horizontally and vertically, yielding a
massive total area, thereby revealing the
poem to be truly great. As you proceed
through the poetry in this book, practice
this rating method. As your ability to
evaluate poems in this matter grows, so
will - so will your enjoyment and
understanding of poetry.

Neil sets the book down and takes off his glasses. The student sitting
across from him is discretely trying to eat. Keating turns away from
the chalkboard with a smile.

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 

KEATING

 
Excrement. That's what I think of Mr. J.
Evans Pritchard. We're not laying pipe,
we're talking about poetry.

Cameron looks down at the graph he copied into his notes and quickly
scribbles it out.

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 

KEATING

 
I mean, how can you describe poetry like
American Bandstand? I like Byron, I give
him a 42, but I can't dance to it.

Charlie suddenly appear to become interested in the class.

 
 

 
 

 
Now I want you to rip out that page.

KEATING

 

The students look at Keating as if he has just gone mad.

 
 
 

 
 
 

 

 
Go on, rip out the entire page. You heard
me, rip it out. Rip it out!

KEATING

Charlie looks around at the others. He then looks down at his own notes,
which consists of drawing breasts.

 
 

 
 

 
Go on, rip it out.

 

KEATING

Charlie rips the page out and holds it up.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 

KEATING

 
Thank you Mr. Dalton. Gentlemen, tell you
what, don't just tear out that page, tear
out the entire introduction. I want it
gone, history. Leave nothing of it. Rip
it out. Rip! Begone J. Evans Pritchard,
Ph.D. Rip, shred, tear. Rip it out. I
want to hear nothing but ripping of Mr.
Pritchard.

Meeks looks around reluctantly and then finally begins tearing out pages.

 
 

 
 

 
We'll perforate it, put it on a roll.

KEATING

 

Keating sees Cameron still hesitating.

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 

KEATING

 
It's not the bible, you're not going to
go to hell for this. Go on, make a clean
tear, I want nothing left of it.

Keating goes over to his room. Cameron turns around to Neil.

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
We shouldn't be doing this.

CAMERON

 

 
Rip, rip, rip!

 

NEIL

Neil makes Cameron turn back around.

 
 

 
 

 
Rip it out, rip!

 

KEATING (O.S.)

From outside the classroom, Mr. McAllister hears all the noise and sees
all the students ripping out the pages. He bursts into the room.

 
 

 
 

 
What the hell is going on here?

MCALLISTER

 

The boys all turn around in shock. Charlie stuffs a crumpled page into his
mouth. Keating emerges from his room with a waste paper basket.

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
I don't hear enough rips.

KEATING

 

 
Mr. Keating.

 

MCALLISTER

 
Mr. McAllister.

 

KEATING

 

 
I'm sorry, I- I didn't know you were
here.

MCALLISTER

 
I am.

 

KEATING

 
MCALLISTER
Ahh, so you are. Excuse me.

 

Mr. McAllister slowly backs out of the classroom.

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 

KEATING

 
Keep ripping gentlemen. This is a battle,
a war. And the casualties could be your
hearts and souls. 

Keating holds out the basket to Charlie who spits out a wad of paper.

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 

KEATING

 
Thank you Mr. Dalton. Armies of academics
going forward, measuring poetry. No, we
will not have that here. No more of Mr.
J. Evans Pritchard. Now in my class you

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

will learn to think for yourselves again.
You will learn to savor words and language.
No matter what anybody tells you, words and
ideas can change the world. I see that look
in Mr. Pitt's eye, like nineteenth century
literature has nothing to do with going to
business school or medical school. Right?
Maybe. Mr. Hopkins, you may agree with him, 
thinking "Yes, we should simply study our
Mr. Pritchard and learn our rhyme and meter
and go quietly about the business of
achieving other ambitions." I have a little
secret for ya. Huddle up. Huddle up! 

The boys get up from their seats and gather around Keating in the center
of the class.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 

KEATING

 
We don't read and write poetry because
it's cute. We read and write poetry
because we are members of the human race.
And the human race is filled with passion.
Medicine, law, business, engineering,
these are all noble pursuits, and necessary
to sustain life. But poetry, beauty,
romance, love, these are what we stay alive
for. To quote from Whitman: "O me, o life
of the questions of these recurring, of the
endless trains of the faithless, of cities
filled with the foolish. What good amid
these, o me, o life? Answer: that you are
here. That life exists, and identity.
That the powerful play goes on, and you
may contribute a verse. That the powerful
play goes on and you may contribute a verse.

Keating looks up at Todd.

 
 

 
 

 
Keating
What will your verse be?

 

INT. HEAD OF CAFETERIA - DAY

The cafeteria is filled with students and teachers standing before the tables saying grace.

 
 
 

 
 
 

 

 
For what we are about to receive, may the
Lord make us truly grateful. Amen.

ALL

Mr. Keating and Mr. McAllister are seated next to one another at the table.

 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 

 
Quite an interesting class you gave today,
Mr. Keating.

MCALLISTER

 
I'm sorry if I shocked you, Mr. McAllister.

KEATING

 

 

 
Oh, there's no need to apologize. It was
very fascinating, misguided though it was.

MCALLISTER

 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
You think so?

 

KEATING

 

MCALLISTER

 
You take a big risk by encouraging them to
be artists John. When they realize they're
not Rembrandts, Shakespeares or Mozarts,
they'll hate you for it.

 

 
We're not talking artists George, we're
talking free thinkers.

KEATING

 
MCALLISTER
Free thinkers at seventeen?

 

 
Funny, I never pegged you as a cynic.

KEATING

 

MCALLISTER

 
  (taken aback by the comment)

 
 
Not a cynic, a realist. Show me the heart
unfettered by foolish dreams, and I'll
show you a happy man.

 

KEATING

 
But only in their dreams can man be truly
free. 'Twas always thus, and always thus
will be.

 
 
Tennyson?

 
No, Keating.

 

MCALLISTER

KEATING

Keating winks and Mr. McAllister can't help but laugh.

INT. CAFETERIA TABLE - DAY

Neil joins the others at the table. He pulls out a yearbook.

 
 
 

 
 
 

 

 
Hey, I found his senior annual in the
library.

NEIL

He hands the annual over to Cameron who laughs at the younger picture of Keating.

 
 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 

NEIL

 
Listen to this, captain of the soccer team,
editor of the school annual, Cambridge
bound, Thigh man, and the Dead Poets Society.

 
 
Man most likely to do anything.

 
    (reading from the annual)

CAMERON

 
Thigh man. Mr. K was a hell-raiser.

CHARLIE

 

 
What's the Dead Poets Society?

KNOX

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
I don't know.

 

NEIL

 
Is there a picture in the annual?

MEEKS

 

 
Nothing. No other mention of it.

NEIL

 

 
That boy there, see me after lunch.

MR. NOLAN (O.S.)

 

Cameron quickly puts the annual away and the others all return to their meal.

EXT. WELTON GROUNDS - DAY

Keating is walking down towards the lake, whistling the same tune as before.
The boys emerge from the building and chase after him.

 
 
 

 
 
 

 

 
Mr. Keating? Mr. Keating? Sir? Oh Captain,
My Captain?

NEIL

Keating immediately turns around.

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
Gentlemen.

KEATING

 
We were just looking in your old annual.

NEIL

 

He hands Keating the annual and Keating looks at his old photograph.

 
 
 

 
 
 

 

 
Oh my God. No, that's not me. Stanley
"The Tool" Wilson-

KEATING

Keating crouches down and continues looking through the book.

 
 

 
 

 
God.

 

KEATING

Neil crouches down next to Keating.

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
What was the Dead Poets Society?

NEIL

 

 

 
I doubt the present administration would
look too favorably upon that.

KEATING

 
Why? What was it?

 

NEIL

 
Gentlemen, can you keep a secret?

KEATING

 

 
Sure.

 

NEIL

The other boys crouch down around Keating.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 

KEATING

 
The Dead Poets were dedicated to sucking
the marrow out of life. That's a phrase
from Thoreau that we'd invoke at the
beginning of each meeting. You see we'd
gather at the old Indian cave and take
turns reading from Thoreau, Whitman,
Shelley; the biggies. Even some of our
own verse. And in the enchantment of the
moment we'd let poetry work its magic.

 

 
You mean it was a bunch of guys sitting
around reading poetry?

KNOX

 

KEATING

 
No Mr. Overstreet, it wasn't just "guys",
we weren't a Greek organization, we were
romantics. We didn't just read poetry,
we let it drip from our tongues like honey.
Spirits soared, women swooned, and gods
were created, gentlemen, not a bad way to
spend an evening eh? Thank you Mr. Perry
for this trip down amnesia lane. Burn that,
especially my picture.

Keating hands the annual back and walks away, whistling once again. Neil
remains crouched.

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
NEIL
Dead Poets Society.

 

 
What?

 

CAMERON

The school bells begin ringing and everyone heads back towards the school.
Neil stands up.

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 
NEIL
I say we go tonight.

 

 
Tonight?

 

CHARLIE

 
Wait a minute.

 

CAMERON

 
Where's this cave he's talking about?

PITTS

 

 

 
It's beyond the stream. I know where it
is.

NEIL

 
That's miles.

 

PITTS

 
Sounds boring to me.

CAMERON

 

 

 

CHARLIE

 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 

Don't go.

 

 
You know how many de-merits we're talking
Dalton

CAMERON

 
CHARLIE
So don't come, please.

 

 

 
Look, all I'm saying is that we have to
be careful, we can't get caught.

CAMERON

 
No shit, Sherlock.

 

CHARLIE

HAGER
 
 
(yelling)
You boys there, hurry up.

 
 

Neil turns around and faces the other boys.

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
NEIL
All right, who's in?

 

 
Come on Neil, Hager's right-

CAMERON

 

 
Forget Hager, no. Who's in?

NEIL

 

 
I'm in.

 

CHARLIE

 
I'm warning you, move.

HAGER (O.S.)

 

 
Me too.

 

CAMERON

 
I don't know Neil

 

PITTS

 
What? Pitts-

 

NEIL

 
Pitsie, come on.

 

CHARLIE

 
His grades are hurting Charlie.

MEEKS

 

 
You can help him Meeks.

NEIL

 

 
What is this, a midnight study group?

PITTS

 

 

 
Forget it Pitts, you're coming. Meeks,
are your grades hurting too?

NEIL

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
I'll try anything once.

MEEKS

 

 
Except sex.

 

 
 
Ha ha ha.

CHARLIE

MEEKS

 
I mean as long as we're careful.

CAMERON

 

The boys run into the building.

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
What about you Knox?

CHARLIE

 

 
KNOX
I don't know Charlie.

 

 
Come on Knox, it'll help you get Chris.

CHARLIE

 

 
 
Yeah? How?

 
Women swoon.

 

KNOX

CHARLIE

Charlie laughs and runs inside. Knox chases after him.

 
 
 

 
 
 

 

 
But why do they swoon? Charlie, tell me
why they swoon. Charlie!

KNOX

INT LIBRARY - DAY

The boys are all gathered around one of the tables with a map laid out
on it.

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 

NEIL

 
    (whispering)

 
 
Okay, follow the stream to the waterfall.
It's right there. It's got to be on the
banks.

 

 
I don't know, it's starting to sound
dangerous.

CAMERON

 
Well, why don't you stay home?

CHARLIE

 

 

 
For God's sake stop chattering and
sit down.

MCALLISTER

The boys take their seats once again and Neil goes over and sits next to
Todd, who is sitting by himself.

 
 

 
 

 
Todd, are you coming tonight?

NEIL

 

 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
No.

 

TODD

 

NEIL

 
Why not? God, you were there. You heard
Keating. Don't you want to do something
about it?

 
 
Yes, but-

 
But? But what?

 

TODD

NEIL

 

 
Keating said that everybody took turns
reading and I don't want to do that.

TODD

 

 
Gosh, you really have a problem with
that, don't you?

NEIL

 

TODD

 
N- no, I don't have a problem. Neil,
I just- I just don't want to do it,
okay?

 

NEIL

 
All right. What if you didn't have to
read? What if you just came and
listened?

 
That's not how it works.

TODD

 

 

 
Forget how it works. What if - what if
they said it was okay?

NEIL

 

 
What? What are you gonna do, go up and
ask them?

TODD

Neil shrugs.

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
No. No, Neil.

 

TODD

 
NEIL
I'll be right back.

 

 
Neil, Neil!

 

TODD

Neil gets up and rejoins the others. McAllister hears the boys whispering
again.

 
 

 
 

 
Oh shut up, will you.

MCALLISTER

 

INT BATHROOM - NIGHT

Various boys are crowded around the sinks getting ready for bed. Someone
is playing snake charmer music on a kazoo while someone else is bothering
Spaz with a red sock puppet acting like a snake.

 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 

 

SPAZ

 
That's my- that's for my asthma, okay.
Could you give that back please? Could
you give that back?

 
What's the matter? Don't you like snakes?

BOY

 

Neil enters and taps Todd on the shoulder.

 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 
You're in.

NEIL

 
Get away from me, okay?

SPAZ

 

 

BOY

 
Spaz, why don't you check your pocket,
huh? Come on Spaz I have to brush my
teeth

 
Get a- get off, 

 

SPAZ

Hager walks past the bathroom and into his room.

 
 

 
 

 
Cut out that racket in there.

HAGER

 

The kazoo player lets out a rude squeek before finally stopping. Hager
glares at them for a moment.

INT NEIL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Neil stands in his doorway. He looks across the hall to the other room
where Cameron and Charlie are standing. Cameron gives a thumbs up. Neil
closes his room door and takes out his cloak and a flashlight. Setting
the flashlight down on the desk, he notices a worn book, "Five
Centuries of Verse", sitting there. Opening it up, he sees John Keating's
name at the top followed by "Dead Poets". Below the title of the book,
is written: "To Be Read At The Opening of D.P.S. Meetings." Along with
several lines from Thoreau, beginning with "I went to the woods because
I wanted to live deliberately…"

INT STAIRWAY - NIGHT

The shadows of hooded figures can be seen moving throughout the darkened
halls.

INT HAGER'S ROOM - NIGHT

Hager hears a dog barking.

INT HALLWAY - NIGHT

Someone drops a number of dog biscuits by the dog's feet. He stops
barking and immediately begins gobbling them down. Hager looks out

into the hallway with his flashlight but sees nothing.

EXT SCHOOL GROUNDS - NIGHT

The boys quietly leave the building and set off running across the
fields towards the woods.

EXT WOODS - NIGHT

The boys search about the trees trying to find the cave. Meeks is
searching around when Charlie leaps up behind Meeks in the dark
shining the flashlight up at his own face and grabs Meeks by the
shoulder.

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

INT CAVE - NIGHT

CHARLIE
 
Arrr, I'm a dead poet.

 

 
Aww, Charlie.

 

MEEKS

 
 
Guys, over here.

 
CHARLIE
    (laughing)

 
You're funny. You're real funny.

MEEKS

 

The boys are trying to start a fire. The cave is quickly filling up with
smoke.

 
 

CHARLIE
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
It's too wet.

 

MEEKS

God, are you trying to smoke us out of
here?

 

 
No, no, the smoke's going right up this
opening.

MEEKS

Pitts tries to stand up and slams his head into the low rock ceiling. He
lets out a yell while the others laugh.

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 
You okay?

NEIL

 
Oh God. Clowns.

 

PITTS

 

 
All right, all right, forget the fire.
Let's go gentlemen.

NEIL

Neil stands before the others with the book in hand, and takes a drag
on a cigarette.

 
 
 

 
 
 

 

 
I hereby reconvene the Dead Poets
Society.

Welton chapter. The meetings will be
conducted by myself and the other new
initiates now present. Todd Anderson,
because he prefers not to read, will
keep minutes of the meetings. I'll now
read the traditional opening message by
society member Henry David Thoreau. "I
went to the woods because I wanted to
live deliberately. I wanted to live deep
and suck out all the marrow of life."

 
I'll second that.

"To put to rout all that was not life,
and not, when I had come to die,
discover that I had not lived.

Several boys whistle softly in reaction to the poem.

 
 
 

 
 
 

 

 
And Keating's marked a bunch of other
pages.

NEIL

Neil begins flipping through the book.

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 

 
All right, intermission. Dig deep right
here. Right here, lay it down

CHARLIE

 

 
On the mud? We're gonna put our food on
the mud?

CAMERON

 
Meeks, put your coat down. Picnic blanket.

CHARLIE

 

 
Yes sir, use Meeks' coat.

MEEKS

 

 

 
Don't keep anything back either. You
guys are always bumming my smokes.

CHARLIE

Meeks lays his coat down and everyone dumps their food on it. Amongst
the pile are chocolate chip cookies, a box of raisins, a few apples, an
orange, and half a roll.

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
Raisins?

 

 
Yuck.

Wait a minute, who gave us half a roll?

Come on.

You want me to put it back?

Neil, lit up by a flashlight, begins to tell everyone a story.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 

 

NEIL

 
It was a dark and rainy night, and this
old lady, who had a passion for jigsaw
puzzles, sat by herself in her house at
her table to complete a new jigsaw puzzle.
But as she pieced the puzzle together, she
realized, to her astonishment, that the
image that was formed was her very own
room. And the figure in the center of the
puzzle, as she completed it, was herself.
And with trembling hands, she placed the
last four pieces and stared in horror at
the face of a demented madman at the
window. The last thing that this old lady
ever heard was the sound of breaking glass.

 
 
Ohhh… no…

BOYS

 
This is true, this is true.

NEIL

 

 

 
I've got one that's even better than
that.

CAMERON

 
Ha!

 

CHARLIE

 

CAMERON

 
I do. There's a young, married couple,
and they're driving through the forest
at night on a long trip. And they run
out of gas, and there's a madman on the-

 
CHARLIE
The thing with the hand-

 

All the boys react, recalling the story and miming the scraping on the
roof of the car.

 
 

 
 

 

 
 

 
 

 

 
I love that story.

 

CAMERON

 
I told you that one.

CHARLIE

 

 

 

CAMERON

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

You did not. I got that in camp in
sixth grade.

 
When were you in six, last year?

CHARLIE

 

As everyone's voices begin to calm down, Pitts begins reading from the
book.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 

The boys laugh.

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

PITTS

 
"In a mean abode in the shanking road,
lived a man named William Bloat. Now,
he had a wife, the plague of his life,
who continually got his goat. And one
day at dawn, with her nightshift on,
he slit her bloody throat."

 
PITTS
Oh, and it gets worse.

 

 
You want to hear a real poem?

CHARLIE

 

Meeks hands Charlie the book but he shoves it away.

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 
All right? No, I don't need it. You take 
it. 

CHARLIE

 
What, did you bring one? 

MEEKS

 

 
You memorized a poem? 

NEIL

 

 
I didn't memorize a poem. Move up.

CHARLIE

 

Neil moves to the side as Charlie stands and takes his spot.

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
An original piece by Charlie Dalton. 

MEEKS

 

 
KNOX
An original piece. 

 

 
Take center stage. 

PITTS

 

 

 
You know this is history. Right? This is 
history.

NEIL

Charlie clears his throat and pulls out a page from a magazine and 
slowly unfolds it, revealing a Playboy centerfold (Elaine Reynolds,
Miss October, 1959)

 
 

 
 

 
 
Oh, wow. 

MEEKS

 
 

 

 
 
 

 
 

 

 
 
 

 
CAMERON
Where did you get that? 

 

 

 

CHARLIE

Teach me to love? Go teach thyself more 
wit.
I, chief professor, am of it.

Neil gets up and looks over Charlie's shoulder to see what he is
reading.

 
 
 

 
 
 

 

 
The god of love, if such a thing there 
be, may learn to love from me.

CHARLIE

Charlie winks at the guys and they clap and cheer.

 
 

 
 

 
Wow! Did you write that?

NEIL

 

Charlie turns over the centerfold to show where he had written down
the poem.

 
 

 
 

 
Abraham Cowley. Okay, who's next? 

CHARLIE

 

Neil sits reading from the book by flashlight.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 

NEIL

 
Alfred Lord Tennyson. 
Come my friends, 
'Tis not too late to seek a newer world 
for my purpose holds to sail beyond the 
sunset. 
And though we are not now that strength 
which in old days 
Moved earth and heaven; that which we 
are, we are;-- 
One equal temper of heroic hearts, 
Made weak by time and fate, but strong 
in will. 
To strive, to seek, to find, and not to 
yield. 

Meeks takes center stage and begins reading a poem like he is 
performing a chant.

Knox picks up a metal container and begins using it as a drum. The
other boys stand and begin going in a circle, making music with
sticks of wood, combs, etc.

The clock tolls two as the boys silently run back to their dorm.

INT. KEATING'S CLASSROOM - DAY

Keating is walking to the front of the classroom filled with students.

 
 
 

 
 
 

 

 
A man is not very tire, he is exhausted.
And don't use very sad, use-

KEATING

He points to the back of the classroom.

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

KEATING

 
Come on, Mr. Overstreet, you twerp, 
 
Morose? 

KNOX

 

 

 

KEATING

 
Exactly! Morose. Now, language was 
developed for one endeavor, and that is? 
Mr. Anderson? Come on! Are you a man or 
an amoeba?

Keating stands before Todd's desk. Todd looks up nervously but
says nothing. Keating paused for a moment before looking away.

 
 

 
 

 
Mr. Perry? 

 

KEATING

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
NEIL
Uh, to communicate. 

 

 

 
No! To woo women. Today we're going to 
be talking about William Shakespeare. 

KEATING

The class lets out a collective sigh.
 
 

 
 
Oh, God! 

BOY

 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 

KEATING

 
I know. A lot of you looked forward to 
this about as much as you look forward 
to root canal work. We're gonna talk 
about Shakespeare as someone who writes 
something very interesting. Now, many of 
you have seen Shakespeare done very much 
like this:

Keating holds out his right arm dramtically and begins to
speak in an exaggerated British accent.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 

"O Titus, bring your friend hither." But
if any of you have seen Mr. Marlon Brando,
you know, Shakespeare can be different. 
"Friend, Romans, countrymen, lend me your
ears." You can also imagine, maybe, John
Wayne as Macbeth going, "Well, is this a 
dagger I see before me?"

INT. KEATING'S CLASSROOM - DAY

The students are all seated together near the front of the room as
Keating reads from a book.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 

KEATING

 
"Dogs, sir? Oh, not just now. I do enjoy 
a good dog once in a while, sir. You can 
have yourself a three-course meal from 
one dog. Start with your canine 
crudites, go to your Fido flambe for 
main course and for dessert, a Pekingese 
parfait. And you can pick your teeth 
with a little paw."

INT. KEATING'S CLASSROOM - DAY

The students are all back in their normal seats and Keating leaps
up onto his desk.

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
Why do I stand up here? Anybody? 

KEATING

 

 
To feel taller. 

 

CHARLIE

 
 
Keating rings the bell on his desk with his foot

KEATING

 
No!

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

KEATING

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

Thank you for playing, Mr. Dalton. I 
stand upon my desk to remind yourself 
that we must constantly look at things 
in a different way. 

Keating glances around the classroom from atop the desk.

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 

KEATING

 
You see, the world looks very different 
from up here. You don't believe me? Come 
see for yourself. Come on. Come on! 

Charlie and Neil quickly rise from their seats to go to the front
of the classroom. The rest of the class follows them. While Keating
continues speaking, Neil and Charlie join him on the desk and then
Keating jumps down.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 

KEATING

 
Just when you think you know something, 
you have to look at it in another way. 
Even though it may seem silly or wrong, 
you must try! Now, when you read, don't 
just consider what the author thinks. 
Consider what you think. 

 

KEATING

 
Boys, you must strive to find your own 
voice. Because the longer you wait to 
begin, the less likely you are to find 
it at all. Thoreau said, "Most men lead 
lives of quiet desperation." Don't be 
resigned to that. Break out!

Keating notices Spaz and another boy leaving the desk immediately.

 
 
 

 
 
 

 

 
Don't just walk off the edge like lemmings.
Look around you. 

KEATING

The school bell rings as the boys continue to climb onto the desk.
Keating begins to gather up his stuff. The clock begins to toll as
Keating walks to the back of the class.

 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 

 

KEATING

 
There! There you go, Mr. Priske. Thank 
you! Yes! Dare to strike out and find 
new ground. Now, in addition to your 
essays, I would like you to compose a 
poem of your own, an original work.

The students begin to groan. Keating begins flickering the lights
off and on while chanting ominously.

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 

KEATING

 
That's right! You have to deliver it 
aloud in front of the class on Monday. 
Bonne chance, gentlemen. 

Keating steps out into the hall before quickly peeking back in once again.
Todd is the last one to stand on the desk and is about to jump off.

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 

KEATING

 
Mr. Anderson? Don't think that I don't 
know that this assignment scares the 
hell out of you, you mole.

Keating flicks the light off, leaving Todd to jump down in the darkness
as the students laugh.

EXT. RIVER - DAY

Cameron, Charlie, and several other boys are rowing while Mr. Nolan
shouts orders from a bullhorn.

EXT. CAMPUS ROOFTOP - DAY

Meeks and Pitts perform a goofy dance together to the music.

INT. TODD'S ROOM - DAY

Todd is on his bed trying to write a poem. The door opens and Todd
turns his writing pad over. Neil enters the room laughing. He crouches
down next to Todd's bed and plunks a sheet of paper in Todd's lap.

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 
I found it. 

 

NEIL

 
You found what? 

 

TODD

 

 
What I wanna do right now. What's 
really, really inside me. 

NEIL

 
"A Midsummer Night's Dream"? 

TODD

 

 
This is it. 

 

 
What is this? 

 

 

 

NEIL

TODD

NEIL

 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

It's a play, dummy. 

 

 
I know that. I-- Wh-Wh-What does it have 
to do with you? 

TODD

 

 
Right. They're putting it on at Henley 
Hall. Open tryouts. Open tryouts! 

NEIL

 
Yes, so?

 

TODD

Neil pounds on the bed and then pulls a blanket off his bed,
wearing it like a cloak.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 

NEIL

 
So, I'm gonna act. Yes, yes! I'm gonna 
be an actor! Ever since I can remember, 
I've wanted to try this. I even tried to 
go to summer stock auditions last year, 
but, of course, my father wouldn't let 
me. For the first time in my whole life 
I know what I wanna do.

Neil grabs a handful of papers off Todd's bed and tosses them into
the air.

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 

 

NEIL

 
and for the first time I'm gonna do it 
whether my father wants me to or not!
Carpe diem! 

 

TODD

 
Neil, Neil, hold on a minute. How are 
you gonna be in a play if your father 
won't let you? 

 

 
First I gotta get the part, then I can 
worry about that. 

NEIL

 

TODD

 
Yeah, but won't he kill you if he finds 
out you went to an audition and didn't 
even tell him? 

 

 
No, no, no, no. As far as I'm concerned, 
he won't have to know about any of this. 

NEIL

 
Well, that's impossible. 

TODD

 

 
Bullshit! Nothing's impossible. 

NEIL

 

 

 
Well, why don't you just call him and 
ask him? And m-maybe he'll say yes. 

TODD

 

 

NEIL

 

 

That's a laugh!

Neil tosses the blanket back onto his bed.

 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 

 
If I don't ask him, at least I won't
be disobeying him. 

NEIL

 
Yeah, but if he said-- 

TODD

 

 
 
Jesus, Todd! Whose side are you on?

 
   (shouting angrily)

NEIL

Todd says nothing. Neil looks at him for a moment and then takes
the flyer back from Todd. He walks over to the window, his 
excitement gone.

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 

NEIL

 
I mean, I haven't even gotten the part 
yet. Can't I even enjoy the idea for a 
little while? 

Once again, Todd says nothing. After a moment, Neil sits on the
heater and Todd returns to his poem.

 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 

 

 
You're coming to the meeting this 
afternoon? 

NEIL

 
TODD
I don't know. Maybe.

 

 

 
Nothing Mr. Keating has to say means 
shit to you, does it, Todd? 

NEIL

 
W-What is that supposed to mean? 

TODD

 

 

NEIL

 
You're in the club! Being in the club 
means being stirred up by things. You 
look about as stirred up as a cesspool. 

Neil gets up from the window and stands over Todd.

 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
TODD
So- You want me out? 

 

 

NEIL

 
No! I want you in, but being in means 
you gotta do something. Not just say 
you're in. 

 

TODD

 
Well, listen, Neil. I-I appreciate this 
concern, but I-I'm not like you. All 
right? You, you, you say thing and 
people listen. I'm, I'm not like that. 

 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
Don't you think you could be? 

NEIL

 

 

TODD

 
No! I--I, I don't know, but that's not 
the point. The, the, the point is that 
there's nothing you can do about it, so 
you can just butt out. I can take care 
of myself just fine. All right? 

 
No. 

 

NEIL

 
What do you mean, "no"? 

TODD

 

A smile comes to Neil's face.

 
 

 
 

 
No. 

 

NEIL

Neil grabs Todd's notebook of poetry and runs across the room with 
it. Todd leaps up after him.

 
 

 
 

 
Give me-- Neil. Neil, give that back. 

TODD

 

The two begin racing in circles around the room, jumping from
bed to bed as Todd tries to grab his poem back.

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 

NEIL

 
"We are dreaming of a--" Poetry! I'm 
being chased by Walt Whitman! Okay, 
okay.

Neil drops the notebook. Cameron walks into the room.

 
 
 

 
 
 

 

 
What are you guys doing? I'm sure-- You 
see this chemistry-

CAMERON

Cameron tries to hold up his book and Neil snatches it from his hands and
suddenly all three of them are racing around the room.

 
 
 

 
 
 

 

 
Hey, give me-- Neil, give me-- Don't be
immature. Come on. I need my- 

CAMERON

Charlie enters the room and begins waving his hands.

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
Give it to me! Give it to me! 

CHARLIE

 

 
Charlie!

 

NEIL

Neil tosses Cameron's book to Charlie.

 
 

 
 

 
Let me have my book, I need my- 

CAMERON

 

The four boys continue racing around the cramped quarters, tossing

Cameron's book back and forth. Neil picks up a recorder and begins
blowing erratic notes on it while Charlie starts pounding on a set of
bongo drums. Outside the room a crowd of boys watch.

EXT. CAMPUS ENTRANCE - DAY

Knox is riding his bike around in circles near the entrance. Seeing no
one nearby, he races through the open gates and down the road. He comes
to the top of a hill and then goes downhill across the grass, shouting
as he sends an immense flock of geese flying into the air.

EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

A number of vehicles drive up, filled with students dressed in bright red
cosyumes, playing trumpets and various other instruments as they pass.
Knox watches the growing crowd of students. They are all converging on
a bus. A football player, wearing a horned helmet, dances on the roof of
the bus. A band is playing while a group of cheerleaders are practising.
Knox spots Chris amongst the cheerleaders. He watches her until Chet
comes along and she grabs hold of his hand. Knox looks away in disgust.

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 

COACH

 
Okay, everybody on the bus. Let's go, 
boys. Come on, let's go. On the bus, 
boys. Now!

Chris jumps into Chet's arms as everyone begins to board the buses. Knox
turns his bike around and leaves.

EXT. SOCCER FIELD - DAY

Keating walks across the field, followed by his students. He kicks a ball
ahead of him while he carries a number of other balls in a net slung over
his shoulder.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 

KEATING

 
Now, devotees may argue that one sport 
or game is inherently better than 
another. For me, sport is actually a 
chance for us to have other human beings 
push us to excel. I want you all to come 
over here and take a slip of paper and 
line up single file.

Keating reaches the stands. He tosses the balls aside and pulls sets
his briefcase down. As the boys line up he begins ripping off slips
of paper from a notepad and handing them out.

 
 
 

 
 
 

 

 
Mr. Meeks, time to inherit the earth. 
Mr. Pitts, rise above your name.

KEATING

He hands the notepad to another student.

 
 
 

 
 
 

 

 
I want you to hand these out to the boys,
one apiece.

KEATING

EXT. SOCCER FIELD - DAY

The students are all lined up in single file, each holding a slip
of paper. Keating blows his whistle.

 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
You know what to do, Pitts. 

KEATING

 

 

 
"Oh to struggle against great odds. To 
meet enemies undaunted." 

PITTS

 

 
Sounds to me like you're daunted. Say it 
again like you're undaunted. 

KEATING

 

 
"Oh to struggle against great odds. To 
meet enemies undaunted." 

PITTS

 
 
Now go on.

KEATING

Pitts gives one of the soccer balls a good kick.

 
 

 
 

 
 
Yes! Next.

KEATING

One of the students sets up the next ball as the line advances.

 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 

 
"To be a sailor of the world, bound for 
all ports." 

BOY 1

 
Next. Louder! 

 

KEATING

 

 
"Oh, I live to be the ruler of life, not 
a slave." 

BOY 2

Keating walks away and starts up a record player.

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 

BOY 3

 
"To mount the scaffolds. To advance to 
the muzzle of guns with perfect 
nonchalance."

Classical music begins playing on the phonograph. Meeks goes to
read next but is confused by the music.

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 

 
Come on, Meeks! Listen to the music. 

KEATING

 

 

 
"To dance, clap hands, exalt, shout, 
skip, roll on, float on." 

MEEKS

 
Yes! 

 

KEATING

 
 

 
 
"Oh, to have life henceforth the poem of 
new joys." 

HOPKINS
(without energy)

Hopkins crumples up his paper and then barely taps the soccer
ball with his foot.

Keating puts a look of disgust on his face.

 
 
 

 
 
 

 

 
Oh! Boo! Come on, Charlie, let it fill 
your soul! 

KEATING

Charlie raises his hands over his head.

 
 

 
 

 
CHARLIE
"To indeed be a god!" 

 

INT. DORM HALLWAY - DAY

Neil is racing down the hallway, all excited.

 
 
 

 
 
 

 

 
Charlie, I got the part! I'm gonna play 
Puck! I'm gonna play Puck!

NEIL

He pounds on Charlie's door.

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
What did he say? 

 

MEEKS

 
Puck? 

 

PITTS

 
That's the main part. 

NEIL

 

 
Great, Neil. 

 

KNOX

 
NEIL
Charlie, I got it! 

 

 

 
Congratulations. Good for you, Neil. 
Good for you. 

CHARLIE

Neil enters his room with Todd and sits down at his typewriter.

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 
Okay, okay, okay, okay. 

NEIL

 

 
Neil, how are you gonna do this? 

TODD

 

 

 
They need a letter of permission from my 
father and Mr. Nolan. 

NEIL

 
You're not gonna write it. 

TODD

 

 
Oh yes, I am. 

 

 

 

NEIL

TODD

 

 

Oh, Neil. Neil, you're crazy. 

 Neil begins typing.

 
 
 

 
 
 

 

 
Okay. "I am writing to you on behalf of 
my son Neil Perry."

    NEIL

Neil begins laughing and stomping his feet up and down.

 
 

 
 

 
This is great.

 

    NEIL

EXT. CAMPUS - NIGHT

A lone bagpiper plays out on the dock.

INT. TODD'S ROOM - NIGHT

Todd is pacing circles about his room as he reads his poem. His
pacing slows and then he tears the poem up.

INT. KEATING'S CLASSROOM - DAY

Knox stands at the front of the room with his poem in hand.

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
"To Chris."

 
 

KNOX
(quietly)

Charlie looks up from his desk with a grin.

 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 

 
Who's Chris? 

 

 
Mmm, Chris. 

 

BOY 1

BOY 2

 

KNOX

 
I see a sweetness in her smile. 
Blight light shines from her eyes. 
But life is complete; contentment is 
mine, 
Just knowing that...

Several students begin to snicker.

 
 

 
 

 
just knowing that she's alive.

KNOX

 

Knox crumples his poem and walks back to his desk.

 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 

 
Sorry, Captain. It's stupid. 

KNOX

 

 

KEATING

 
No, no. It's not stupid. It's a good 
effort. It touched on one of the major 
themes, love. A major theme not only in 
poetry, but life. Mr. Hopkins, you were 
laughing. You're up.

Hopkins slowly walks to the front of the class and unfolds
his piece of paper.

 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
"The cat sat on the mat." 

HOPKINS

 

 

KEATING

 
Congratulations, Mr. Hopkins. Yours is 
the first poem to ever have a negative 
score on the Pritchard scale. We're not 
laughing at you, we're laughing near 
you. I don't mind that your poem had a 
simple theme. Sometimes the most 
beautiful poetry can be about simple 
things, like a cat, or a flower or rain. 
You see, poetry can come from anything 
with the stuff of revelation in it. Just 
don't let your poems be ordinary. Now, 
who's next? 

Keating approaches Todd's desk.

 
 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 

KEATING

 
Mr. Anderson, I see you sitting there in 
agony. Come on, Todd, step up. Let's put 
you out of your misery. 

 

 
I, I didn't do it. I didn't write a 
poem. 

TODD

 

KEATING

 
Mr. Anderson thinks that everything 
inside of him is worthless and 
embarrassing. Isn't that right, Todd? 
Isn't that your worst fear? Well, I 
think you're wrong. I think you have 
something inside of you that is worth a 
great deal.

Keating walks up to the blackboard and begins to write.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 

KEATING

 
"I sound my barbaric yawp over the 
rooftops of the world." W. W. Uncle Walt 
again. Now, for those of you who don't 
know, a yawp is a loud cry or yell. Now, 
Todd, I would like you to give us a 
demonstration of a barbaric "yawp." Come 
on. You can't yawp sitting down. Let's 
go. Come on. Up.

Todd reluctantly stands and follows Keating to the front.

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
You gotta get in "yawping" stance. 

KEATING

 

 
A yawp?

 

TODD

 
No, not just a yawp. A barbaric yawp. 

KEATING

 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
Yawp. 

 
 

TODD
(quietly)

 
Come on, louder. 

 

KEATING

 
 
Yawp. 

 
 

TODD
(quietly)

 
No, that's a mouse. Come on. Louder. 

KEATING

 

 
Yawp. 

 

TODD

 
Oh, good God, boy. Yell like a man! 

KEATING

 

 
 
Yawp! 

 
 

TODD
(shouting)

 

 
There it is. You see, you have a 
barbarian in you, after all.

KEATING

Todd goes to return to his seat but Keating stops him.

 
 

 
 

 
Now, you don't get away that easy.

KEATING

 

Keating turns Todd around and points out a picture on the wall.

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 

KEATING

 
The picture of Uncle Walt up there. What 
does he remind you of? Don't think. 
Answer. Go on.

Keating begins to circle around Todd.

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 

 
A m-m-madman. 

 

TODD

 

 
What kind of madman? Don't think about 
it. Just answer again. 

KEATING

 
A c-crazy madman. 

 

TODD

 

KEATING

 
No, you can do better than that. Free up 
your mind. Use your imagination. Say the 
first thing that pops into your head, 
even if it's total gibberish. Go on, go 
on. 

 
Uh, uh, a sweaty-toothed madman. 

TODD

 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 

KEATING

 
Good God, boy, there's a poet in you, 
after all. There, close your eyes. Close 
your eyes. Close 'em. Now, describe what 
you see. 

Keating puts his hands over Todd's eyes and they begin to slowly
spin around.

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
Uh, I-I close my eyes. 

TODD

 

 
Yes? 

 

KEATING

 
Uh, and this image floats beside me. 

TODD

 

 
A sweaty-toothed madman? 

KEATING

 

 

 
A sweaty-toothed madman with a stare 
that pounds my brain. 

TODD

 

 
Oh, that's excellent. Now, give him 
action. Make him do something. 

KEATING

 
H-His hands reach out and choke me. 

TODD

 

 
That's it. Wonderful. Wonderful.

KEATING

 

Keating removes his hands from Todd but Todd keeps his eyes
closed.

 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 

 
And, and all the time he's mumbling. 

TODD

 

 
What's he mumbling? 

KEATING

 

 

TODD

 
M-Mumbling, "Truth. Truth is like, like 
a blanket that always leaves your feet 
cold." 

The students begin to laugh and Todd opens his eyes. Keating
quickly gestures for him to close them again.

 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 

 
Forget them, forget them. Stay with the 
blanket. Tell me about that blanket. 

KEATING

 

TODD

 
Y-Y-Y-You push it, stretch it, it'll 
never be enough. You kick at it, beat 
it, it'll never cover any of us. From 
the moment we enter crying to the moment 

 
 

 
 

we leave dying, it will just cover your 
face as you wail and cry and scream. 

Todd opens his eyes. The class is silent. Then they begin to clap
and cheer.

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
Don't you forget this.

 
   (whispering to Todd)

KEATING

EXT. SOCCER FIELD - DAY

Keating's students are playing a soccer game. After they score the
winning goal they hoist Keating onto their shoulders and carry him
away.

INT. CAVE - DAY

The boys are all sitting around the cave lighting their pipes.
 
 

 
Attaboy, Pittsie, inhale deeply. 

CHARLIE

 
 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
My dad collects a lot of pipes. 

MEEKS

 

 
Really? Mine's got thirty. 

CHARLIE

 

 

 
Your parents collect pipes? Oh, that's 
really interesting. 

PITTS

 
CHARLIE
Come on, Knox. Join in. 

 

 

 
Yeah, Knox, we're from the government. 
We're here to help, man. 

MEEKS

 
What's wrong? 

 

CHARLIE

 

 
It's Chris. Here's a picture of Chris 
for you.

PITTS

Pitts holds up a centerfold.

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 
Smoke that. Put that in your pipe and 
smoke it. 

MEEKS

 
That's not funny. 

 

KNOX

 
Knock it off. Smoke your pipes. 

CHARLIE

 

 
Neil!

 

MEEKS

Neil enters the cave carrying a beat up light stand.

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
Friend, scholar, Welton men. 

NEIL

 

MEEKS
 
What is that, Neil? 

 

 
Duh. It's a lamp, Meeks.

PITTS

 

Neil removes the shade from the lamp, revealing the shape of a man
as the base of the lamp.

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
No. This is the god of the cave. 

NEIL

 

 
MEEKS
The god of the cave.

 

Charlie begins making loud noises with his saxophone.

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
Charlie, what are you doing? 

PITTS

 

 
What do you say we start this meeting? 

CHARLIE

 

 

 
Y-Yeah, just-- I need a light. I just 
gotta- 

BOY 1

 
Got my earplugs?

 

BOY 2

Charlie stands up and clears his throat.

 
 
 

 
 
 

 

 
Gentlemen, "Poetrusic" by Charles 
Dalton.

CHARLIE

Charlie begins playing erratic notes on the sexophone.

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
Oh, no. 

 

MEEKS

 

 
Laughing, crying, tumbling, mumbling. 
Gotta do more. Gotta be more. 

CHARLIE

Charlie plays more erratic sounds.

 
 
 

 
 
 

 

 
Chaos screaming, chaos dreaming. Gotta 
do more! Gotta be more!

CHARLIE

Charlie starts to play a real tune on the saxophone.

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
Wow! 

 

MEEKS

 
That was nice. That was great. Where did 

PITTS

 

 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

Knox jumps up.
 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

you learn to play like that? 

 

 
My parents made me take the clarinet for 
years. 

CHARLIE

 
I love the clarinet. 

CAMERON

 

 

 
I hated it. The saxophone. The saxophone 
is more sonorous. 

CHARLIE

 
Ooh. 

 

CAMERON

 
Vocabulary. 

 

MEEKS

 

 
I can't take it anymore. If I don't have 
Chris, I'm gonna kill myself. 

KNOX

 
Knoxious, you've gotta calm down. 

CHARLIE

 

 

KNOX

 
No, Charlie. That's just my problem. 
I've been calm all my life. I'll do 
something about that. 

 
NEIL
Where are you going? 

 

 
CHARLIE
What are you gonna do? 

 

 
KNOX
I'm gonna call her.

 

Knox begins to chuckle as he leaves the cave. The others
quickly grab their coats to follow him. Charlie goes back to
playing noise on his saxophone again.

INT. HALLWAY - DAY

Knox is making a call from the payphone.

 
 

 
 

 
Hello?

 

CHRIS (O.S.)

Knox immediately hangs up and looks at the other boys who are
all gathered around him.

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 

KNOX

 
She's gonna hate me. The Danburrys will 
hate me. My parents will kill me. 
All right, goddamn it. You're right. 
"Carpe diem." Even if it kills me. 

Knox puts in another coin and calls again.

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 

 
Hello? 

 

CHRIS (O.S.)

 
Hello, Chris? 

 

KNOX

 
Yes. 

 

CHRIS (O.S.)

 
Hi. This is Knox Overstreet. 

KNOX

 

 
Oh, yes. Knox. Glad you called. 

CHRIS (O.S.)

 

 
KNOX
She's glad I called. 

 

 

CHRIS (O.S.)

 
Listen, Chet's parents are going out of 
town this weekend, so he's having a 
party. Would you like to come? 

 
Would I like to come to a party? 

KNOX

 

 
Yes. Say, yes. 

 

CHARLIE

 
Friday? Um- 

 

 
Well, sure. 

 

 
About seven? 

 

CHRIS (O.S.)

KNOX

CHRIS (O.S.)

 
Okay, great. I-I'll be there, Chris. 

KNOX

 

 
Okay. 

 

CHRIS (O.S.)

 

 
Friday night at the Danburrys'. O-Okay. 
Thank you. 

KNOX

 
Okay. Bye. 

 

CHRIS (O.S.)

 
Thank you. I'll see you. Bye. 

KNOX

 

 

KNOX

 
Yawp! Can you believe it? She was gonna 
call me. She invited me to a party with 
her. 

 
At Chet Danburry's house. 

CHARLIE

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 

 
Yeah. 

 
Well? 

 
So? 

 

 

 

KNOX

CHARLIE

KNOX

 

 
So, you don't really think she means 
you're going with her? 

CHARLIE

 

KNOX

 
Well, of course not, Charlie. But that's 
not the point. That's not the point at 
all. 

 
What is the point? 

 

CHARLIE

 
The point, Charlie, is, uh-- 

KNOX

 

 
Yeah? 

 

CHARLIE

 

KNOX

 
that she was thinking about me. I've 
only met her once, and already she's 
thinking about me. Damn it. It's gonna 
happen, guys. I feel it. She is going to 
be mine. Carpe. Carpe!

Knox flips his scarf dramatically around his neck as he walks away
and climbs the stairs.

EXT. COURTYARD - DAY

The students are standing in a line while Cameron, Pitts, and Knox
are walking in a circle. Keating watches as they go around.

 
 
 

 
 
 

 

 
No grades at stake, gentlemen. Just take 
a stroll.

KEATING

After a few moments, the three boys begin to march to the same beat.

 
 

 
 

 
There it is. 

 

KEATING

The other boys start clapping to the rhythm of their steps.

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
I don't know, but I've been told-- 

KEATING

 

 
I don't know, but I've been told-- 

BOYS

 

 
KEATING
Doing poetry is old-- 

 

 
 

 
 

 
Doing poetry is old-- 

BOYS

 

Mr. Nolan looks out at them from his office as Keating joins the
boys and begins marching with them.

 
 
 

 
 
 

 

 
Left, left, left-right-left. Left, left, 
left-right-left. Left, halt! 

KEATING

The boys come to a halt.

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 

KEATING

 
Thank you, gentlemen. If you noticed, 
everyone started off with their own 
stride, their own pace.

Keating begins walking very slowly.

 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 

 

KEATING

 
Mr. Pitts, taking his time. He knew he'll
get there one day. Mr. Cameron, you could
see him thinking, "Is this right? It might
be right. It might be right. I know that. 
Maybe not. I don't know."

Keating begins walking with his groin pushed forward.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 

KEATING

 
Mr. Overstreet, driven by deeper force.
Yes. We know that. All right. Now, I
didn't bring them up here to ridicule
them. I brought them up here to illustrate
the point of conformity: the difficulty in 
maintaining your own beliefs in the face 
of others. Now, those of you -- I see 
the look in your eyes like, "I would've 
walked differently." Well, ask 
yourselves why you were clapping. Now, 
we all have a great need for acceptance. 
But you must trust that your beliefs are 
unique, your own, even though others may 
think them odd or unpopular, even though 
the herd may go, "That's baaaaad." Robert 
Frost said, "Two roads diverged in a 
wood and I, I took the one less traveled 
by, and that has made all the 
difference." Now, I want you to find 
your own walk right now. Your own way of 
striding, pacing. Any direction. 
Anything you want. Whether it's proud, 
whether it's silly, anything. Gentlemen, 
the courtyard is yours.

The students begin walking about, some walking casually, others
making up silly walks. Keating notices that Charlie is still
leaning up against one of the pillars.

 
 
 

 
 
 

 

 
You don't have to perform. Just make it 
for yourself. Mr. Dalton? You be joining 

KEATING

 

 
 

 
 
 
 

 

 
 

 
 
 
 

us? 

 
Exercising the right not to walk. 

CHARLIE

 

 

KEATING

 
Thank you, Mr. Dalton. You just 
illustrated the point. Swim against the 
stream.

Nolan moves away from the window where he had been watching them.

EXT. CAMPUS - NIGHT

Neil is walking by with the notes for the play when he notices Todd
sitting off by himself on one of the walkways.

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
Todd? Hey. 

 

 
Hey. 

 

NEIL

TODD

 
What's going on?

 

NEIL

 
Nothing. Today's my birthday. 

TODD

 

 
Is today your birthday? Happy birthday. 

NEIL

 

 
Thanks. 

 

TODD

 
What's you get? 

 

NEIL

 
My parents gave me this. 

TODD

 

Neil looks down at a deskset sitting next to Todd, still in
its wrappings.

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 

 
Isn't this the same desk set- 

NEIL

 

 

 
Yeah, yeah. They gave me the same thing 
as last year. 

TODD

 
Oh. 

 
Oh. 

 

 

NEIL

TODD

 
 

 
 
Maybe they thought you needed another 
one. 

NEIL
 (laughing)

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 

 

TODD

 
Maybe they weren't thinking about 
anything at all. Uh, the funny thing is 
about this is I, I didn't even like it 
the first time. 

 

 
Todd, I think you're underestimating the 
value of this desk set.

NEIL

Neil picks up the desk set and begins examining it more closely.

 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 

 
I mean, who would want a football or
a baseball, or-

NEIL

 
 
Or a car. 

TODD

 

NEIL

 
Or a car if they could have a desk set 
as wonderful as this one? I mean, if, if 
I were ever going to buy a, a desk set 
twice, I would probably buy this one 
both times. In fact, its, its shape is, 
it's rather aerodynamic, isn't it? I can 
feel it. This desk set wants to fly.

Neil tosses the desk set lightly in the air. Todd stands up
and Neil hands him the desk set.

 
 
 

 
 
 

 

 
Todd? The world's first unmanned flying 
desk set.

NEIL

Todd flings the desk set over the side of the walkway and it
falls to pieces down below.

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
Oh, my! 

 

TODD

 

 
Well, I wouldn't worry. You'll get 
another one next year.

NEIL

INT. CAVE - NIGHT

All the boys but Knox and Charlie are gathered in the cave.

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 

BOYS

 
"To live deep and suck out all the 
marrow of life. To put to rout all that 
was not life"

The boys stop as they hear the sound of female laughter outside.

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
Oh, my God! 

 

 
Is this it? 

 

CAMERON

GLORIA

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 
Yeah, this is it. Go ahead, go on in. 
It's my cave. Watch your step. 

CHARLIE

 
We're not gonna slip, are we? 

TINA

 

 
Uh-oh.

 

GLORIA

Gloria hops into the cave wearing a bright red shirt. The lights from
the boys' flashlights play conspicously over Gloria's chest. Tina
enters right behind her.

 
 

 
 

 
Hi.

 

GLORIA

Meeks stands up and slams his head into the low ceiling.

GLORIA

 
Hi, you guys. Meet, uh, Gloria and--

TINA

 

 
Tina. This is the pledge class of the 
Dead Poets Society.

Hello. 

 

 
Hi. Hi. 

 

NEIL

GLORIA

 

CHARLIE

 
Guys, move. Move. Come on, folks. It's 
Friday night. Let's get on with the 
meeting.

The boys move aside to let the girls in.

 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 

 

 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 

 

 
Sorry. Excuse- Excuse me. 

BOYS

 

 

CHARLIE

 
Guys, I have an announcement to make. In 
keeping with the spirit of passionate 
experimentation of the Dead Poets, I'm 
giving up the name Charlie Dalton. From 
now on, call me Nuwanda. 

 

 

PITTS

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
Nuwanda? 

 
 
Nuwanda? 

(laughing)

NEIL

Tina takes out a tube of red lipstick. Charlie takes it from her
and puts red marks on each of his cheeks.

INT. CHET'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Knox enters the house and looks anxiously about.

 
 

 
 

 
KNOX
Hello? Hello, Chris?

 

Knox stops and combs his hair in the hallway mirror. Chris comes
running out from one of the rooms.

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
Knox! 

 
Hi. 

 

 

CHRIS

KNOX

 
You made it. Great! Bring anybody? 

CHRIS

 

 
No. 

 

KNOX

Chris grabs Knox by his jackets and pulls him forward as she walks
toward the stairs.

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 

CHRIS

 
No. Ginny Danburry's here. Wait. I have 
to go find Chet. Why don't you go 
downstairs where everybody is?

Chris runs up the stairs as Knox stares after her.

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
Make yourself at home. 

CHRIS

 

 
But I--

 

KNOX

INT. CHET'S BASEMENT - NIGHT

Knox stares at a couple kissing passionately. Across the room he sees
Chet and Chris dancing. He walks away.

INT. CHET'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

Knox enters the kitchen, walking between several football players
to fill up a mug of beer from a keg.

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 

STEVE

 
Hey, you Mutt Sanders' brother? Bubba, 
this guy look like Mutt Sanders to you 
or what? 

Bubba spits ice cubes into the sink.

 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
BUBBA
You're his brother? 

 

 

 
No relation. Never heard of him. Sorry, 
guys. 

KNOX

BUBBA

 
  (obviously drunk)

 
 
Where's your manners Steve? Mutt Sanders' 
brother, we don't even offer him a 
drink. Here. Go have some whiskey, pal. 

Bubba hands Knox a glass and fills it up.

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
Yeah. 

 

STEVE

 
Whoa, I, uh, I don't really drink-- 

KNOX

 

 
 
To Mutt. 

 
To Mutt.

 

BUBBA

STEVE

The two guys raise their glasses in a toast and Knox reluctantly
joins them.

 
 

 
 

 
To Mutt.

 

KNOX

They each take a big drink. Knox rolls his eyes and gasps,
loosening his tie to try and breathe.

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
Now, how the hell is old Mutt, anyway? 

BUBBA

 

 
Yeah. What's ol' Mutter been up to, huh? 

STEVE

 

 
I don't really know Mutt. 

KNOX

 

 
To Mighty Mutt. 

 

BUBBA

 
To Mighty Mutt. 

 

GUY 1

 
To Mighty Mutt.

 

KNOX

They raise their glasses again for a toast and down the rest
of their glasses.

 
 
 

 
 
 

 

 
Well, listen, I gotta go find Patsy. Say 
hello to Mutt for me, okay? 

BUBBA

 
 

 
 

 
Will do.

 

KNOX

Bubba puts on a horned football helmet and walks away.

 
 

 
 

 
Yeah. Hell of a guy, your brother Mutt.

STEVE

 

INT. CAVE - NIGHT

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
We gonna have a meeting or what? 

CHARLIE

 

 

 
Yeah. If you guys don't have a meeting, 
how do we know if we wanna join? 

GLORIA

 
Join? 

 

NEIL

Charlie leans over to Tina.

 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

CHARLIE

 
"Shall I compare thee to a summer's day? 
Thou art more lovely and more 
temperate." 

 
That's so sweet. 

 

TINA

 
I made that up just for you. 

CHARLIE

 

 
You did?

 

TINA

The boys laugh and Cameron shakes his head. Charlie moves over
to sit next to Gloria.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 

CHARLIE

 
I'll write one for you too, Gloria. 
She walks in beauty like the night. 
She walks in beauty like the night. 
Of cloudless climes and starry skies. 
All that's best, dark and bright, 
Meet in her aspect and her eyes. 

 
That's beautiful. 

 

GLORIA

 

 
There's plenty more where that came 
from.

CHARLIE

INT. CHET'S BASEMENT - NIGHT

The room is whirling as Knox belches and staggers across the room. He
passes Chet and several of his friends. He steps over several couples
kissing on the floor and slump down on the couch, only to be crowded
in by another couple who seem oblivious to him. He is about to get up
again when he notices Chris sleeping next to him on the couch.

 
 

 
 

 
God help me.

 

KNOX

Knox looks about and then looks back down at Chris.

 
 

 
 

 
Carpe diem.

 

KNOX

Knox takes a last swig of his drink  and then begins to softly run his
fingers over Chris' hair. He then leans over and kisses her forehead.
Across the room, Bubba looks over and sees what's going on.

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
Chet! Chet! Look! 

 

BUBBA

 
What? 

 

CHET

 
It's Mutt Sanders' brother. 

BUBBA

 

 
Huh? 

 

CHET

Chris rises up from the couch and looks at Knox in surprise.

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
Knox, what-- 

 

CHRIS

 
And he's feeling up your girl! 

BUBBA

 

 
CHRIS
What are you doing? 

 

Chet gets up from his chair.

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
What the hell are you doing? 

CHET

 

 
Chet! Chet, don't. 

CHRIS

 

 

 
Now, Chet, I know this looks bad, but 
you've gotta-

KNOX

Chet throws himself at Knox, hurling them both to the floor. He
then straddles Knox and begins to punch at him as Knox simply
tries to protect himself.

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 
Chet, no! You'll hurt him! No! No! Stop 
it! Leave him alone! 

CHRIS

 
 
Goddamn! 

CHET

 
Chet, stop it!

 

CHRIS

Chris manages to haul Chet away from Knox.

 
 

 
 

 
Bastard!

 

CHET

Knox takes his hands away from his face and feels at his bloody
nose. Chris tries to help him up.

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
Knox, are you all right? 

CHRIS

 

 
Chris, get the hell away from him! 

CHET

 

CHRIS
 
Chet, you hurt him! 

 

 
Good! 

 

CHET

 
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. 

KNOX

 

 
It's okay. It-It's okay.

CHRIS

 

Chet hauls Chris away from Knox and then points at him.

 
 

 
 

 
Next time I see you, you die. 

CHET

 

INT. CAVE - NIGHT

Tina passes a bottle of alcohol to Neil.

 
 

 
 

 
Go ahead, pass it around. 

TINA

 

Cameron motions for Neil not to take it but Neil takes a swig anyway.
There is a moment of awkward silence.

 
 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 

MEEKS

 
Me and Pitts are working on a hi-fi 
system. It shouldn't be that hard to, 
uh, to put together. 

 

 
Yeah. Uh, I might be going to Yale. Uh, 
uh, but, I, I might not. 

PITTS

 

 
Don't you guys miss having girls around 
here? 

GLORIA

 
 
Yeah.

 
 

MEEKS AND PITTS
  (smiling)

 

CHARLIE

 
That's part of what this club is about. 
In fact, I'd like to announce I 
published an article in the school 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

paper, in the name of the Dead Poets. 

 
What? 

 

CAMERON

 
Demanding girls be admitted to Welton. 

CHARLIE

 

 
You didn't. 

 

PITTS

 
 
 
    (whispering to Meeks)
So we can all stop beating off. 

CHARLIE

 
NEIL
How did you do that? 

 

 

 
I'm one of the proofers. I slipped the 
article in. 

CHARLIE

 
Look, uh, it's, it's over now. 

MEEKS

 

 
Why? Nobody knows who we are. 

CHARLIE

 

 

CAMERON

 
Well, don't you think they're gonna 
figure out who wrote it? They're gonna 
come to you and ask to know what the 
Dead Poets Society is. Charlie, you had 
no right to do something like that. 

 
CHARLIE
It's Nuwanda, Cameron. 

 

 
That's right. It's Nuwanda. 

GLORIA

 

 

CHARLIE

 
Are we just playing around out here, or 
do we mean what we say? For all we do is 
come together and reach a bunch of poems 
to each other. What the hell are we 
doing? 

 

NEIL

 
All right, but you still shouldn't have 
done it, Charlie. This could mean 
trouble. You don't speak for the club. 

 

CHARLIE

 
Hey, would you not worry about your 
precious little neck? If they catch me, 
I'll tell them I made it up. 

INT. ASSEMBLY HALL - DAY

The professors hurry down the steps, lead by an obviously agitated

Mr. Nolan. Several are carrying newspapers in their hands. The
students all rise as they enter. After all the professors have
taken their places, Mr. Nolan addresses the students.

 
 

 
 

 
Sit.

The students all sit.

 

MR. NOLAN

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 

MR. NOLAN

 
In this week of Welton's Honor there 
appeared a profane and unauthorized 
article. Rather than spend my valuable 
time ferreting out the guilty persons -- 
and let me assure you I will find them -
- I'm asking any and all students who 
knows anything about this article to 
make themselves known here and now. 
Whoever the guilty persons are, this is 
your only chance to avoid expulsion from 
this school.

The sound of a phone ringing can be heard. The professors look
about for its source. Charlie picks up a telephone receiver.

 
 
 

 
 
 

 

 
Welton Academy. Hello. Yes, he is. Just 
a moment.

CHARLIE

Charlie stands up, holding a phone and bell in his hands.

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 

CHARLIE

 
Mr. Nolan, it's for you. It's 
God. He says we should have girls at 
Welton.

Most of the students laugh while the boys from the cave all shake
their heads in disbelief.

INT. NOLAN'S OFFICE - DAY

Charlie stands with his back to the door as Mr. Nolan shuts it. Mr. 
Nolan then walks around to face Charlie.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 

MR. NOLAN

 
Wipe that smirk off your face. If you 
think, Mr. Dalton, that you're the first 
to try to get thrown out of this school, 
think again. Others have had similar 
notions and have failed just as surely 
as you will fail. Assume the position.

Charlie sighs and bends over, resting his hands on the desk. Mr.
Nolan hefts a flat wooden paddle in his hands.

 
 

 
 

 
MR. NOLAN
Count aloud, Mr. Dalton.

 

Mr. Nolan begins to strike Charlie with the paddle.

 
 

 
 

 
One. Two. Three. Four. Five. 

CHARLIE

 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 

 
What is this Dead Poets Society? I want 
names.

MR. NOLAN

INT. HALLWAY - DAY

A crowd of students is gathered about as Charlie stiffly walks back to his room.

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
You kicked out? 

 

NEIL

 
No. 

 

CHARLIE

 
So what happened? 

 

NEIL

 

 
I'm to turn everybody in, apologize to 
the school and all will be forgiven. 

CHARLIE

 
So, what are you gonna do? Charlie! 

NEIL

 

 
Damn it, Neil. The name is Nuwanda.

CHARLIE

 

Charlie smiles and then shuts his door.

INT. KEATING'S CLASSROOM - DAY

Keating and McAllister are enjoying tea in the small room off the
classroom. Mr. Nolan knocks on the door and enters.

 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 

 
Excuse me. May we have a word, Mr. 
Keating? 

MR. NOLAN

 
 
Certainly.

KEATING

Keating fixes his tie and follows Mr. Nolan into the classroom.

 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 

 
This was my first classroom, John. Did 
you know that? My first desk. 

MR. NOLAN

 
Didn't know you taught, Mr. Nolan. 

KEATING

 

 

MR. NOLAN

 
English. Oh, long before your time. It 
was hard giving it up, I can tell you. 
I'm hearing rumors, John, about some 
unorthodox teaching methods in your 
classroom. I'm not saying they've 
anything to do with the Dalton boy's 
outburst. But I don't think I have to 
warn you boys his age are very 
impressionable. 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 

 
Well, your reprimand made quite an 
impression, I'm sure. 

KEATING

 

 
What was going on in the courtyard the 
other day? 

MR. NOLAN

 
Courtyard? 

 

KEATING

 
Yeah. Boys marching, clapping in unison. 

MR. NOLAN

 

 

 
Oh, that. That was an exercise to prove 
a point. Dangers of conformity. 

KEATING

 

MR. NOLAN

 
Well, John, the curriculum here is set. 
It's proven it works. If you question, 
what's to prevent them from doing the 
same? 

 

 
I always thought the idea of educating 
was to learn to think for yourself. 

KEATING

 

MR. NOLAN

 
At these boys' ages? Not on your life! 
Tradition, John. Discipline. Prepare 
them for college, and the rest will take 
care of itself.

INT. STUDY ROOM - DAY

Charlie sits with his bongos as the other boys are all crowded
around him. He hits the bongoes as he mimes Nolan's footsteps.

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 

CHARLIE

 
Creak. He started walking around towards 
my left. Creak. Creak. "Assume the 
position, Mr. Dalton."

The door opens and Keating walks in. Many of the boys get up from
their seats.

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
It's all right, gentlemen. 

KEATING

 

 
Mr. Keating. 

 

CHARLIE

 

 
Mr. Dalton. That was a pretty lame stunt 
you pulled today. 

KEATING

 

CHARLIE

 
You're siding with Mr. Nolan? What about 
Carpe diem and sucking all the marrow 
out of life and all that? 

 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 

KEATING

 
Sucking the marrow out of life doesn't 
mean choking on the bone. Sure there's a 
time for daring and there's a time for 
caution, and a wise man understands 
which is called for. 

 
But I thought you'd like that. 

CHARLIE

 

 

KEATING

 
No. You being expelled from school is 
not daring to me. It's stupid, 'cause 
you'll miss some golden opportunities. 

 
Yeah. Like what? 

 

CHARLIE

 

 
Like, if nothing else, the opportunity 
to attend my classes. Got it, Ace? 

KEATING

 
Aye, aye, Captain. 

 

CHARLIE

 

 
Keep your head about you. That goes for 
the lot of you. 

KEATING

 
Yes, Captain. 

 

BOYS

 

 
Phone call from God. If it had been 
collect, it wouldn't been daring.

KEATING

Keating leaves and the boys gather around Charlie once again.

 
 

 
 

 
All right. Go on.

 

CHARLIE

EXT. CAMPUS - DAY

Neil bikes away as the clock bell tolls.

INT. THEATER - DAY

Neil walks into the back of the theater and watches various
actors rehearsing on stage. A smile fills his face.

 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
We're trying to rehearse, okay? Start. 

DIRECTOR

 

 

 
A good persuasion, therefore hear me, 
Hermia. 

LYSANDER

 

DIRECTOR

 
Wait, please. Excitement. I don't hear 
any excitement about this play. And take 
her hand. Bring her down the stage and 
stop. And "There, gentle Hermia." Okay? 

 

 

Try again.

INT. HALLWAY - DAY

The bell rings and students rush down the hall.

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
BOY
What's for dinner? 

 

 
Spaghetti and meatballs!

PITTS

 

Neil comes up the stairs as everyone else swarms down to the cafeteria.

 
 
 

 
 
 

 

 
Save some for me. "But, room, Fairy! 
Here comes Oberon."

Neil opens the door to his room and sees his father sitting at his desk.

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
Father.

Mr. Perry rises from the desk.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 

MR. PERRY

 
Don't you dare talk back to me! It's bad 
enough that you've wasted your time with 
this, this absurd acting business. But 
you deliberately deceived me! How, how, 
how did you expect to get away with 
this? Answer me. Who put you up to it? 
Was it this new man? This, uh, Mr. 
Keating? 

 

 
No. Nobody-- I thought I'd surprise you. 
I've gotten all A's in every class. 

NEIL

 

MR. PERRY

 
Did you think I wasn't going to find 
out? "Oh, my niece is in a play with 
your son," says Mrs. Marks. "No, no, 
no," I say, "you must be mistaken. My 
son's not in a play." You made me a liar 
of me, Neil! Now, tomorrow you go to 
them and you tell them that you're 
quitting. 

 

 
No, I can't. I have the main part. The 
performance is tomorrow night. 

NEIL

 
I don't care if the world comes to an

that play. Is that clear? Is that clear? 

 
 
Yes, sir. 

NEIL

Mr. Perry goes to leave and then turns around.

 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 

 

MR. PERRY

 
I made a great many sacrifices to get 
you here, Neil, and you will not let me 
down. 

 
 
No, sir. 

NEIL

INT. KEATING'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Keating is seated at his desk. He is writing a letter and occasionally
looks up at the framed photo on his desk of a woman playing the cello.
There is a knock at the door.

 
 

 
 

 
 
It's open.

KEATING

Neil enters and closes the door behind him. He appears to be nervous.

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
Neil, what's up? 

 

KEATING

 
Can I speak to you a minute? 

NEIL

 

 
Certainly. Sit down.

KEATING

 

Neil goes to take a seat but notices the chair is piled up with books.
Neil picks them up and Keating gets up from his seat to help him.

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
I'm sorry. Here. 

 

NEIL

 
Excuse me. Get you some tea? 

KEATING

 

 
 
Tea. Sure.

NEIL

Keating goes to a table in the corner and begins pouring several cups.

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
Like some milk or sugar in that? 

KEATING

 

 
No, thanks. 

 

NEIL

 

 
Gosh, they don't give you much room 
around here. 

NEIL

 
No, it's part of the monastic oath. They 

KEATING

 

 
 

 
 

don't want worldly things distracting me 
from my teaching.

Keating gives Neil a cup of tea and they return to their seats. Neil
looks at the photo on the desk.

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 

 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 

 

 
She's pretty. 

 

NEIL

 

 
She's also in London. Makes it a little 
difficult. 

KEATING

 
How can you stand it? 

NEIL

 

 
Stand what? 

 

KEATING

 

 
You can go anywhere. You can do 
anything. How can you stand being here? 

NEIL

 

 
'Cause I love teaching. I don't wanna be 
anywhere else. 

KEATING

 
What's up? 

 

KEATING

 

NEIL

 
I just talked to my father. He's making 
me quit the play at Henley Hall. 
Acting's everything to me. I-- But he 
doesn't know. He-- I can see his point. 
We're not a rich family like Charlie's, 
and we-- But he's planning the rest of 
my life for me, and I-- H-He's never 
asked me what I want. 

 

KEATING

 
Have you ever told your father what you 
just told me? About your passion for 
acting. You ever show him that? 

 
 
I can't. 

 
 
Why not? 

NEIL

KEATING

 
I can't talk to him this way. 

NEIL

 

 

KEATING

 
Then you're acting for him, too. You're 
playing the part of the dutiful son. I 
know this sounds impossible, but you 
have to talk to him. You have to show 
him who you are, what your heart is. 

 

 

NEIL

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

I know what he'll say. He'll tell me 
that acting's a whim, and I should 
forget it. That how they're counting on 
me. He'll just tell me to put it out of 
my mind, "for my own good." 

 

KEATING

 
You are not an indentured servant. If 
it's not a whim for you, you prove it to 
him by your conviction and your passion. 
You show him that And if he still 
doesn't believe you, well, by then 
you'll be out of school and you can do 
anything you want. 

A tear falls down Neil's cheek and he wipes it away.

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 
No. What about the play? The show's 
tomorrow night. 

NEIL

 

 
Well, you have to talk to him before 
tomorrow night. 

KEATING

 
Isn't there an easier way? 

NEIL

 

 
No. 

 

KEATING

 
I'm trapped. 

 

NEIL

 
No, you're not.

 

KEATING

EXT. CAMPUS - DAY

Knox exits one of the doors. The ground is covered with a thick
layer of snow. He looks around to see if anyone is about and then
hurries over to the bike rack. grabbing one of the bikes, he hurries
off.

INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY

A crowd of students come in from the cold. Knox pushes his way through
them, carrying a handful of wildflowers. He begins searching for Chris.

 
 

 
 

 
Chris!

 

KNOX

He approaches a girl with hair similar to Chris' and turns her around,
only to realize that it's not her.

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
Chris Noel. Do you know where she is? 

KNOX

 

 
Um, I think she's in room 111.

GIRL

 

The girl points down the hallway and Knox sets off in that direction.

 
 

 
 

 
Thanks.

 

KNOX

Chris is at her locker talking to a friend. She just closes her locker
as she notices Knox coming towards her. She turns away.

 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 

 
Excuse me. Chris. 

 

KNOX

 
Knox, what are you doing here? 

CHRIS

 

 

KNOX

 
I came to apologize for the other night. 
I brought you these and a poem I wrote 
for you.

Chris pulls him aside, out of the main hallway.

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 

 
Knox, don't you know that, if Chet finds 
you here he'll kill you? 

CHRIS

 
I can't care. I love you, Chris. 

KNOX

 

 
CHRIS
Knox, you're crazy. 

 

 

 
Look, I acted like a jerk and I know it. 
Please, accept these. Please. 

KNOX

 
No. No-- I, I can't. Forget it.

CHRIS

 

Chris walks away. The school bell rings and she enters her
classroom, closing the door behind her. Undaunted, Knox follows,
opening the door and standing before her desk.

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
Knox, I don't believe this. 

CHRIS

 

 
All I'm asking you to do is listen.

KNOX

 

As Knox begins to read his poem, the classroom grows quiet as
everyone stops to listen.

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 

KNOX

 
The heavens made a girl named Chris 
With hair and skin of gold. 
To touch her would be paradise.

Chris holds her head in her hands in embarrassment.

INT. CAMPUS KITCHEN - DAY

Knox sneaks in through a side door. He snatches a slice of toast
from the counter and motions to one of the staff to keep secret.
He then begins to eat the toast as he hurries away.

INT. STAIRWAY - DAY

The school bell rings and Knox pushes his way up the stairs past
the slower students. At the top he joins the other boys where they
are grabbing their books.

 
 

 
 

 
Get out of here. Cameron, you fool.

CHARLIE

 

Charlie notices Knox and grabs his jacket.

 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 

 
Hey, how'd it go? Did you read it to
her? 

CHARLIE

 
Yeah.

 

KNOX

The boys begin to get all excited but Charlie shushes them.

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
What'd she say? 

 

PITTS

 
 
Nothing. 

KNOX

 
Nothing. What do you mean, nothing? 

CHARLIE

 

 
Nothing. But I did it.

KNOX

 

Knox walks away down the hall and the others chase after him.

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 
What did she say? I know she had to say 
something. 

CHARLIE

 
Come here, Knox. 

 

PITTS

 
Seize the day!

 

KNOX

INT. KEATING'S CLASSROOM - DAY

Keating walks from the front of the classroom to Neil's desk. Neil
is the only student remaining in the class.

 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 

 
Did you talk to your father? 

KEATING

 

 

NEIL

 
Uh, he didn't like it one bit, but at 
least he's letting me stay in the play. 
He won't be able to make, make it. He's 
in Chicago. But, uh, I think he's gonna 
let me stay with acting. 

 
Really? You told him what you told me? 

KEATING

 

 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 

 

NEIL

 
Yeah. He wasn't happy. But he'll be gone 
at least four days. I don't think he'll 
make the show, but I think he'll let me 
stay with it. "Keep up the school work." 
Thanks.

Neil picks up his books and leaves.

INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

The boys are grooming themselves in front of the mirrors.

 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
Beautiful baby. 

 

PITTS

 

 
Beautiful baby. Henley Hall, here I 
come. 

MEEKS

 

 
Excuse me, just a moment. Yes. You're so 
cute.

CAMERON

Cameron runs a comb through his hair and Todd tries to mess it up.

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 
Come on, Todd. I'm trying to fix 
this. 

CAMERON

 

 
Come on, Nuwanda. You're gonna miss 
Neil's entrance. 

TODD

 

 
He said something about getting red 
before we left. 

PITTS

 
Getting red? What does that mean? 

CAMERON

 

 
I, uh-- Well, you know Charlie.

PITTS

 

One of the stalls opens and Charlie's hand emerges, holding a small
brush and a bottle of red paint.

 
 
 

 
 
 

 

 
So, Charlie, what's this "getting red" 
bit?

CAMERON

Charlie opens his unbuttoned shirt to show a large red lightning bolt
painted down his chest.

 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 

 
W-What is that? 

 

TODD

 

CHARLIE

 
It's an Indian warrior symbol for 
virility. Makes me feel potent, like it 
can drive girls crazy.

Charlie buttons up his shirt as everyone prepares to leave.

 
 
 

 
 
 

 

 
Oh, come on, Charlie. The girls are 
waiting.

TODD

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

The boys are walking down the hall to leave. Cameron stops and stares.
The other boys notice and stop as well. Charlie softly whistles at Chris
standing by the door. Knox stares at her in surprise

 
 

 
 

 
Chris.

 

KNOX

Knox leaves the other boys to join her.

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
What are you doing here? 

KNOX

 

 
Gentlemen, let's go. 

 

KEATING (O.S.)

 
Go ahead, guys. I'll catch up. 

KNOX

 

 
Yeah, come on, guys.

CHARLIE

 

Charlie hustles the boys away. Meeks remains staring at her. Charlie
returns to drag him away.

 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 

 

KNOX

 
Chris, you can't be in here. I-If they 
catch you, we're both gonna be in big 
trouble. 

 
Oh, but it's fine--

CHRIS

 

Knox shushes her and leads her out the door.

EXT. CAMPUS - NIGHT

Snow is lightly falling as Chris and Knox walk outside.

 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 

 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 

 

CHRIS

 
It's fine for you to come barging into 
my school and make a complete fool out 
of me? 

 
I didn't mean to make a fool out of you. 

KNOX

 

 

CHRIS

 
Well, you did. Chet found out. And it 
took everything I could do to keep him 
from coming here and killing you. Knox, 
you have got to stop this stuff. 

 

 

KNOX

 

 
 
 

 

 
 
 

I can't, Chris. I love you. 

 

 
Knox, you say that over and over. You 
don't, you don't even know me. 

CHRIS

Keating calls out from a nearby car.

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
Will you be joining us, Mr. Overstreet?

KEATING

 

 
Go ahead, Captain. I'll walk. 

KNOX

 

 

 
Knox, Knox, it just so happens that I 
could care less about you? 

CHRIS

 

 
Then you wouldn't be here warning me 
about Chet. 

KNOX

 

 
I have to go. I'm gonna be late for the 
play. 

CHRIS

 
Are you going with him? 

KNOX

 

 
 
Chet? To a play? Are you kidding? 

CHRIS
   (laughs)

 
 

 
KNOX
Then come with me. 

 

 
Knox, you are so infuriating. 

CHRIS

 

 

KNOX

 
Come on, Chris. Just give me one chance. 
If you don't like me after tonight, I'll 
stay away forever. 

 
Uh-huh. 

 

CHRIS

 

KNOX

 
I promise. Dead Poets Honor. You come 
with me tonight. And then, if you don't 
want to see me again, I swear I'll bow 
out. 

 

 
You know what would happen if Chet found 
out? 

CHRIS

 

KNOX

 
He won't know anything. We'll sit in the 
back and sneak away as soon as it's 
over. 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 
And I suppose you would promise that 
this would be the end of it. 

CHRIS

 
Dead Poets Honor. 

 

KNOX

 
What is that? 

 

CHRIS

 
My word.

 

KNOX

Chris walks away from him and then turns to face him.

 
 

 
 

 
You are so infuriating.

CHRIS

 

Chris gestures for Knox to follow her. Charlie does a little 
twirl as he joins her and puts his arm around her. They walk away.

INT. THEATER - NIGHT

The audience is packed. The stage is set up to resemble a forest and
lights dance about it. From behind a bush, Neil emerges, wearing a
crown of twigs and berries and twigs on his hands. In the audience,
Charlie emerges from his seat, all excited.

 
 

 
 

 
Hey, there he is! Hey, hey.

CHARLIE

 

Cameron shoves him back into his seat.

 
 

 
 

 
 
Shh, boys.

KEATING

On stage, Neil hides behind a tree as a girl emerges, similarly clad,
but with flowers in her hair. Neil sneaks over to the girl.

 

 
 
 
 
 

 

 

 

 
 
 
 
 

 

 

 

 

FAIRY

Either I mistake your shape and making 
quite, 
Or else you are that shrewd and knavish 
sprite 
Call'd Robin Goodfellow: 

 

 

PUCK

Thou speak'st aright;

In the audience, Chris and Knox enter and are shown to seats.

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 

PUCK

 
I am that merry wanderer of the night. 
I jest to Oberon and make him smile 
When I a fat and bean-fed horse beguile,

Puck makes horse sounds and the audience laughs.

 
 

 
 

 
Neighing in likeness of a filly foal: 

PUCK

 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 

And sometime lurk I in a gossip's bowl, 
In very likeness of a roasted crab, 
And when she drinks, against her lips I 
bob 
And on her wither'd dewlap pour the ale. 
The wisest aunt, telling the saddest 
tale,

In the audience, Charlie leans over towards Keating.

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
He's good. He's really good.

CHARLIE
  (whispering)

 
 

Keating gives a thumbs up.

 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 

 
 

 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 

 
 

 

 

PUCK

Sometime for three-foot stool mistaketh 
me; 
Then slip I from her bum, down topples 
she, 
And "tailor" cries, and falls into a 
cough; 
And then the whole quire hold their hips 
and laugh, 
And waxen in their mirth and neeze and 
swear 
A merrier hour was never wasted there. 
But, room, Fairy! here comes Oberon. 

 

 

FAIRY

And here my mistress. Would that he were 
gone!

The two actors hide behind the trees, lifting their twig covered
hands to hide themselves.

INT. THEATER - NIGHT

Two other actors are onstage. 

 

 
 

 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 

 
 

 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 

 

LYSANDER

Then by your side no bed-room me deny; 
For lying so, Hermia, I do not lie 

 

 

HERMIA

Lysander riddles very prettily: 
Now much beshrew my manners and my 
pride, 
If Hermia meant to say Lysander lied. 
But, gentle friend, for love and 
courtesy 
Lie further off; in human modesty, 
Such separation as may well be said 
Becomes a virtuous bachelor and a maid, 
and, good night, sweet friend: 
Thy love ne'er alter till thy sweet life 
end!

Neil is watching the actors from the wing. He glances out at the audience
and sees his father enter the back of the theater. Neil backs away into
the shadows.

 

 

 

 

 

 

LYSANDER

Amen, amen, to that fair prayer, say I;

The director breaks Neil out of his thoughts.

 
 
 

 
 
 

 

 
Neil. That's your cue, Neil. Come on, 
Neil. Here's your crown. Let's go.

DIRECTOR

Neil reluctantly replaces his crown and follows her.

INT. THEATER - NIGHT

On stage, Neil collects dew in a leaf and holds it over his head while
fairies dance about. In the audience, Knox takes Chris' hand in his.

INT. THEATER - NIGHT

The stage is dark. A spotlight comes on to reveal Neil with his back to
the audience. He slowly turns around to face the audience and his father.

 

 

 

 

 

 

PUCK

If we shadows have offended,

Neil directs his eyes at his father, who stills stands at the back
of the theater.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 

PUCK

 
Think but this, and all is mended, 
That you have but slumber'd here 
While these visions did appear. 
And this weak and idle theme, 
No more yielding but a dream, 
Gentles, do not reprehend: 
If you pardon, we will mend: 
And, as I am an honest Puck, 
If we have unearned luck 
Now to 'scape the serpent's tongue, 
We will make amends ere long; 
Else the Puck a liar call; 
So, good night unto you all. 
Give me your hands, if we be friends, 
And Robin shall restore amends.

Neil backs away and the curtains close as the audience begins to
applaud enthusiastically. Behind the curtain numerous people
congratulate Neil as they line up for the curtain call. The curtains
open. Charlie and the other boys rise to their feet, followed quickly
by the rest of the audience. The actors bow to continued applause. The
actors push Neil forward and he takes a second bow.

 
 

 

 
 

 

 
Yawp! 

 

 

 

BOYS

KNOX

 

 

Yeah, Neil!

The curtain closes again and Neil turns around, letting out an
excited sigh. Various actors continue to congratulate him. Neil
lets out a yell as he walks offstage. In the audience, while others
are leaving, Mr. Perry approaches a woman.

 
 
 

 
 
 

 

 
Excuse me, I'm Neil's father. I need to 
see him.

MR. PERRY

Backstage, the woman approaches Neil.

 
 

 
 

 
Neil, Your father. He's-

WOMAN

 

Neil nods in agreement.

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
What did you think?

ACTOR

 

 

 
Really I thought you were all just 
wonderful!

WOMAN

Neil emerges from the curtains, carrying his costume. The theater is
nearly empty now, except for Mr. Perry standing at the back. Neil
smiles at him but the smile quickly disappears.

EXT. THEATER - NIGHT

Mr. Perry pushes his way through the crowd of people, with Neil close
behind.

 
 

 
 

 
Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.

MR. PERRY

 

The boys notice Neil and try to dtop him to talk.

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
Neil, Neil, you were great. 

CHARLIE

 

 
I can't, guys. 

 

NEIL

 
Neil! Neil!

 

TODD

Outside of the crowd, Keating manages to catch up to Neil. He takes
hold of Neil's coat.

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 

KEATING

 
Neil. Neil. You have the gift. What a 
performance You left even me speechless. 
You have to stay with-

Mr. Perry returns from his car and shoves Neil aside.

 
 
 

 
 
 

 

 
Get in the car. Keating, you stay away 
from my son. 

MR. PERRY

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
Neil! Neil! Mr. Perry, come on. 

CHARLIE

 

 
Don't make it any worse than it is.

KEATING

 

Neil and Mr. Perry get into their car and drive away. Keating
stares after them.

 
 

 
 

 
Is it okay if we walk back? Captain?

CHARLIE

 

Charlie motions Todd to follow.

 
 

 
 

 
Knox.

 

CHARLIE

The boys leave and Keating continues to stare after the car, wiping
the falling snow from his face.

INT. MR. PERRY'S STUDY - NIGHT

A photo of Neil standing stiffly with his parents sits on a table
between a glass of alcohol and a half filled ashtray. Mrs. Perry
watches through the window as her husband and son arrive and then
takes a nervous puff on her cigarette before sitting down. Mr.
Perry walks in with Neil close behind him. Neil sits down beside the
desk while Mr. Perry remains standing.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 

MR. PERRY

 
We're trying very hard to understand why 
it is that you insist on defying us. 
Whatever the reason, we're not gonna let 
you ruin your life. Tomorrow I'm 
withdrawing you from Welton and 
enrolling you in Braden Military School. 
You're going to Harvard and you're gonna 
be a doctor. 

 

 
But that's ten more years. Father, 
that's a lifetime! 

NEIL

 

MR. PERRY

 
Oh, stop it. Don't be so dramatic. You 
make it sound like a prison term. You 
don't understand, Neil. You have 
opportunities that I never even dreamt 
of and I am not going to let you waste 
them.

Neil rises to his feet.

 
 

 
 

 
I've got to tell you what I feel.

NEIL

 

Mrs. Perry stands up.

 
 

 

 
 

 

 
We've been so worried about-- 

MRS. PERRY

 

 

 

MR. PERRY

 
 

 
 

What? What? Tell me what you feel. What 
is it?

Neil looks to his mother and then back to his father but says
nothing.

 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 

 

MR. PERRY

 
Is it more of this, this acting 
business? Because you can forget that. 
What? 

 
Nothing.

 

NEIL

Neil sits back down dejectedly.

 
 

 
 

 
Nothing? Well, then, let's go to bed.

MR. PERRY

 

Mr. Perry leaves. Mrs. Perry pauses on her way out and kneels
behind Neil.

 
 

 
 

 
I was good. I was really good.

NEIL

 

Mrs. Perry nods slightly.
 
 
 

 
Go on, get some sleep.

 
 

MRS. PERRY

INT. MR. PERRY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Mrs. Perry sits on the side of the bed with her back to her
husband. Mr. Perry removes his robe and slippers before
getting in to bed. Mrs. Perry begins to cry as he turns out
the light.

 
 
 

 
 
 

 

 
It's all right. It's going to be all 
right.

MR. PERRY

INT. NEIL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Neil's pyjamas, bathrobe, towel, and shaving kit are all neatly
laid out on his bed. Neil touches his pyjamas lightly and then
removes his coat and shirt. He walks over to the windows and
opens them, taking several deep breaths. He places the crown of
twigs on his head and then closes his eyes, slowly letting his head
fall to his chest.

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

A door opens and Neil emerges, slowly walking down the stairs as if
in a trance.

INT. MR. PERRY'S STUDY - NIGHT

Neil holds a key in his hands. He unlocks a drawer in his father's
desk and pulls out a pistol, wrapped in cloth.

INT. MR. PERRY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Mr. Perry jerks up out of bed, startled and breathing fast.

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
What was that? 

 

MR. PERRY

 
What? 

 

 
That sound. 

 

MRS. PERRY

MR. PERRY

 
What sound? Tom?

 

MRS. PERRY

Mr. Perry turns on the light and gets up out of bed, putting on his
robe and slippers.
 
 
MRS. PERRY
What is it? What's wrong? 
 

 
 

 

Mr. Perry turns on the hallway light and knocks on Neil's door. He opens
the door and goes inside.

 
 

 
 

 
Neil.

 

MR. PERRY

Mr. Perry notices the open window.

 
 

 
 

 
Tom, what is it? What's wrong? Neil?

MRS. PERRY

 

Mr. Perry continues to look through the house, continuing downstairs.

 
 

 
 

 
Neil?

 

MR. PERRY

Mr. Perry notices the door to his study is ajar.

 
 

 
 

 
I'll look outside. Neil?

MRS. PERRY

 

Mr. Perry flicks the light on but sees nothing. Then he smells
something. Looking closer, he sees a thin cloud of smoke rising from
behind his desk. As he moves around the desk he sees his gun on the
floor and Neil's outstretched hand.

 
 

 
 

 
No!

 

MR. PERRY

Mr. Perry crouches down by his son.

 
 

 
 

 
Oh, Neil! Oh, my God!

MR. PERRY

 

Mrs. Perry enters the room and sees her son.

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
Oh! No! 

 

 
Oh, my son! 

 

MRS. PERRY

MR. PERRY

 
He's all right. 

 

MRS. PERRY

 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 

 
My son! My poor son! 

MR. PERRY

 

MRS. PERRY

 
    (crying hysterically)

 
 
He's all right! He's all right! He's all 
right! He's all right! He's all right! 
He's all right! 

 
MR. PERRY
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it.

 

Mr. Perry holds his wife and tries to comfort her.

INT. TODD'S ROOM - NIGHT

Todd is sleeping. Charlie reaches across to wake him. Tears are
running down his face.

 
 

 
 

 
Todd? Todd.

 

CHARLIE

Todd, still half asleep, tries to shrug him off.

 
 

 
 

 
Oh, Charlie.

 

TODD

Todd opens his eyes and sees Charlie's face

 
 

 
 

 
What is it?

 

TODD

Todd looks over to see Pitts, Meeks, and Knox by the door.

 
 

 
 

 
Neil's dead.

 

CHARLIE

EXT. CAMPUS - DAY

It is a snowy, overcast morning. Todd walks through the snow. He
has his coat on over his pyjamas. The other boys follow closely
behind him as he walks down towards the water. He stops and stares
out at the snow-covered surroundings.

 
 

 
 

 
It's so beautiful.

 

TODD

Todd begins to gag and then goes down on his knees, vomiting into
the snow. The other boys huddle around him, hugging him.

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
CHARLIE
Todd. It's okay, Todd. 

 

 
Calm down. 

 

PITTS

 
CHARLIE
It's all right, Todd. 

 

 
Todd, it's okay. It's okay, Todd. 

PITTS

 

 
 

 
 

 
It's all right. It's alright.

CHARLIE

 

Charlie grabs a handful of snow and wipes Todd's mouth with it. 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
He wouldn't-- He wouldn't have done it. 

TODD

 

 
You can't explain it, Todd. 

MEEKS

 

 
TODD
It was his father! 

 

 
No! 

 

CHARLIE

 

TODD

 
He wouldn't have left us. It's because he-
He wouldn't have. His dad was-- his, his 
father did it. 

 
Todd. 

 

CHARLIE

 
His father killed him. He made him do it.

TODD

 

 
You can't explain it, Todd.

MEEKS

 

Todd pushes himself away from the boys and stumbles down the hill,
slipping and falling in the snow.

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
Todd! 

 

MEEKS

 
Leave him be.

 

CHARLIE

The boys watch as Todd runs down towards the dock by the river,
yelling and crying. He finally seems to regain control of himself
and walks in silence out onto the dock.

INT. KEATING'S CLASSROOM - DAY

Keating sits by himself at his desk. After a moment he gets up
and walks over to Neil's desk. Opening it, he finds his copy
of "Five Centuries of Verse" and flips through the first few pages.
Sitting down at the desk, he returns to the opening page, reading
the opening verse written there. Keating begins to sob, then closes
the book.

INT. ASSEMBLY HALL - DAY

A church service is going on. The boys have joined in the other
students in a hymn. Charlie is the only one not singing. He stares
off into nothingness.

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

BOYS
 (singing)

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

All my life 
Thy light shall surely follow me 
And in God's house forevermore 
My dwelling place shall be 
Amen.

Mr. Nolan stands at the pulpit, with the rest of the professors
seated behind him.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 

MR. NOLAN

 
The death of Neil Perry is a tragedy. He 
was a fine student. One of Welton's 
best. And he will be missed. We've 
contacted each of your parents to 
explain the situation. Naturally, 
they're all quite concerned. At the 
request of Neil's family, I intend to 
conduct a thorough inquiry into this 
matter. Your complete cooperation is 
expected.

INT. CLOAKROOM - DAY

The boys (except Cameron) are sitting about the cluttered room
waiting. Charlie lights a cigarette.

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
You told him about this meeting? 

CHARLIE

 

 
Twice. 

 

PITTS

 
That's it, guys. We're all fried. 

CHARLIE

 

 
How do you mean? 

 

PITTS

 

 
Cameron's a fink. He's in Nolan's office 
right now, finking. 

CHARLIE

 
About what? 

 

PITTS

 

CHARLIE

 
The club, Pittsie. Think about it. The 
board of directors, the trustees and Mr. 
Nolan. Do you think for one moment 
they're gonna let this thing just blow 
over? Schools go down because of things 
like this. They need a scapegoat.

The door opens. All the boys except Charlie hurry to put
their cigarettes out and wave the smoke away. A light comes on
and Cameron enters.

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
CAMERON
What's going on, guys? 

 

 
You finked, didn't you, Cameron?

CHARLIE

 

Charlie gets up and approaches Cameron, tossing his cigarette away.

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 

 

 
Finked? I didn't know what the hell 
you're talking about. 

CAMERON

 

 
You told Nolan everything about the club 
is what I'm talking about. 

CHARLIE

 

CAMERON

 
Look, in case you hadn't heard, Dalton, 
there's something called an honor code 
at this school, all right? If a teacher 
asks you a question, you tell the truth 
or you're expelled. 

 
You little-

 

CHARLIE

Charlie lunges at Cameron but Knox and Meeks hold him back.

 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
Charlie! 

MEEKS

 

 
He's a rat! He's in it up to his eyes, 
so he rattled to save himself. 

CHARLIE

 

 
Don't touch him, Charlie. You do and 
you're out. 

KNOX

 
I'm out anyway! 

 

CHARLIE

 
You don't know that, not yet. 

KNOX

 

 

CAMERON

 
He's right there, Charlie. And if you 
guys are smart, you will do exactly what 
I did and cooperate. They're not after 
us. We're the victims. Us and Neil. 

 
What's that mean? Who are they after? 

CHARLIE

 

 

CAMERON

 
Why, Mr. Keating, of course. The 
"Captain" himself. I mean, you guys 
didn't really think he could avoid 
responsibility, did you? 

 

 
Mr. Keating responsible for Neil? Is 
that what they're saying? 

CHARLIE

 

 
Well, who else do you think, dumb ass? 
The administration? Mr. Perry? Mr. 

CAMERON

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 

Keating put us up to all this crap, 
didn't he? If he wasn't for Mr. Keating, 
Neil would be cozied up in his room 
right now, studying his chemistry and 
dreaming of being called doctor. 

 

TODD

 
That is not true, Cameron. You know 
that. He didn't put us to anything. Neil 
loved acting. 

 

 
Believe what you want, but I say let 
Keating fry. I mean, why ruin our lives?

CAMERON

Charlie lunges at Cameron again and punches him in the face.
Cameron falls to the floor as the boys pull Charlie away. Cameron
lifts a hand to his bloody nose.

 
 
 

 
 
 

 

 
You just signed your expulsion papers, 
Nuwanda.

CAMERON

Cameron rises to his feet.

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 

CAMERON

 
And if the rest of you are smart, you'll 
do exactly what I did. They know 
everything anyway. You can't save 
Keating, but you can save yourselves.

Cameron walks away, closing the door behind him.

INT. TODD'S ROOM - DAY

Todd looks out the window and watches as Hager escorts Meeks back
to the dorm. Inside the room, Neil's bed has been stripped of all
its bedding.

INT. HALLWAY - DAY

Meeks walks slowly to his room. Hager remains standing at the end of
the hallway.

 
 

 
 

 
Knox Overstreet.

 

HAGER

Knox emerges from his room and goes to joing Hager. He gives a thumbs
up to Todd as he passes his door. Once he leaves with Hager, Todd goes
over to Meeks' door.

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
Meeks? 

 

TODD

 
Go away. I have to study. 

MEEKS

 

 
What happened to Nuwanda? 

TODD

 

 
 
Expelled. 

MEEKS

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
TODD
What'd you tell 'em? 

 

 
Nothing they didn't already know. 

MEEKS

 

 
Todd Anderson.

 

HAGER (O.S.)

INT. HALLWAY - DAY

Todd is lead up the steps to Mr. Nolan's office by Hager.

INT. NOLAN'S OFFICE - DAY

Todd enters the room to see his mother and father seated opposite
Mr. Nolan's desk.

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
Hello, son. 

 

MR. ANDERSON

 
Hello, darling. 

 

MRS. ANDERSON

 
Mom.

 

TODD

THe door closes behind Todd. He remains standing, not knowing
what to do.

 
 

 
 

 
MR. NOLAN
Have a seat, Mr. Anderson.

 

Todd sits down next to his parents.

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 

MR. NOLAN

 
Mr. Anderson, I think we've pretty well 
put together what's happened here. You 
do admit to being a part of this Dead 
Poets Society?

Todd says nothing.

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
Answer him, Todd. 

 

MR. ANDERSON

 
 
Yes, sir.

TODD

Mr. Nolan puts his glasses on and glances at a paper before him
before removing his glasses once more.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 

MR. NOLAN

 
I have here a detailed description of 
what occurred at your meetings. It 
describes how your teacher, Mr. Keating, 
encouraged you boys to organize this 
club and to use it as a source of 
inspiration for reckless and self-
indulgent behavior. It describes how Mr. 
Keating, both in and out of the 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 

classroom, encouraged Neil Perry to 
follow his obsession with acting when he 
knew all along it was against the 
explicit order of Neil's parents. It was 
Mr. Keating's blatant abuse of his 
position as teacher that led directly to 
Neil Perry's death. 

Mr. Nolan motions to Todd's father, who passes along a sheet of
paper to Todd.

 
 
 

 
 
 

 

 
Read that document carefully, Todd. Very 
carefully.

MR. NOLAN

Todd looks at the paper, which already contains the signatures of
the other four boys.

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 
If you've nothing to add or amend, sign 
it. 

MR. NOLAN

 
What's gonna happen to Mr. Keating? 

TODD

 

 
I've had enough. Sign the paper, Todd.

MR. ANDERSON

 

Mr. Nolan holds out a pen for Todd to take.

EXT. CAMPUS - DAY

Mr. McAllister leads his students, textbooks in hand, through the
snow outside the classrooms.

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 

McALLISTER

 
Grass is gramen or herba. Lapis is 
stone. The entire building is 
aedificium.

Keating looks out from his office window. McAllister pauses and looks
up at Keating, giving him a brief wave. Keating waves back.

INT. KEATING'S OFFICE - DAY

Keating laughs slightly as he watches McAllister from the window.
Inside, all his belongings have been packed up.

INT. KEATING'S CLASSROOM - DAY

The students are all seated at their desks in silence. Everyone looks
as the door opens. They quickly stand as Mr. Nolan enters the room.

 
 

 
 

 
Sit.

 

MR. NOLAN

The students sit once again as Mr. Nolan walks to the front of the room.

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 

MR. NOLAN

 
I'll be teaching this class through 
exams. We'll find a permanent English 
teacher during the break. Who will tell 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

me where you are in the Pritchard 
textbook? 

 
Mr. Anderson?

 

MR. NOLAN

 
Uh, in the, in the Pr- 

TODD

 

 
I can't hear you, Mr. Anderson. 

MR. NOLAN

 

 
In the, in the, in the Pritchard? 

TODD

 

 
Kindly inform me, Mr. Cameron. 

MR. NOLAN

 

 

CAMERON

 
We skipped around a lot, sir. We covered 
the Romantics and some of the chapters 
on Post Civil War literature. 

 
MR. NOLAN
What about the Realists? 

 

 
I believe we skipped most of that, sir. 

CAMERON

 

 

 
All right, then, we'll start over. What 
is poetry?

MR. NOLAN

There is a knock at the classroom door.

 
 

 
 

 
Come.

 

MR. NOLAN

The students look back as the door opens. They quickly turn
away when hey see it is Keating.

 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 

 
Excuse me. I came for my personals. 
Should I come back after class? 

KEATING

 
Get them now, Mr. Keating. 

MR. NOLAN

 

 

MR. NOLAN

 
Gentlemen, turn to page 21 of the 
introduction. Mr. Cameron, read aloud 
the excellent essay by Dr. Pritchard on 
"Understanding Poetry."

Todd slowly closes his book. Keating opens the door to the tiny
room off the classroom.

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
That page has been ripped out, sir. 

CAMERON

 

 
Well, borrow somebody else's book. 

MR. NOLAN

 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
They're all ripped out, sir. 

CAMERON

 

 

 
What do you mean, they're all ripped 
out? 

MR. NOLAN

 
Sir, we, uh- 

 

 
Never mind.

 

CAMERON

MR. NOLAN

Mr. Nolan takes his own book over to Cameron's desk and then
slaps the open page.

 
 

 
 

 
Read!

 

MR. NOLAN

As Cameron begins to read, Keating looks out at Todd as he puts
his scarf on. Todd looks at him for a moment and then glances away.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 

CAMERON

 
"Understanding Poetry by Dr. J Evans 
Pritchard, Ph.D. To fully understand 
poetry, we must first be fluent with its 
meter, rhyme and figures of speech, then 
ask two questions: 1) How artfully has 
the objective of the poem been rendered 
and 2)..."

The door squeaks as Keating shuts it behind him. Cameron pauses. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 

CAMERON

 
"... How important is that objective? 
Question 1 rates the poem's perfection; 
question 2 rates its importance. And 
once these questions have been answered, 
determining the poem's greatness becomes 
a relatively simple matter. If the 
poem's score for perfection is plotted 
on the horizontal of a graph--"

Keating passes by Todd and the others and gets to the back of the
classroom before Todd leaps up from his seat and turns to face him.

 
 
 

 
 
 

 

 
Mr. Keating! They made everybody sign 
it. 

TODD

Mr. Nolan gets up from his desk and approaches Todd.

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
Quiet, Mr. Anderson. 

MR. NOLAN

 

 
You gotta believe me. It's true. 

TODD

 

 
KEATING
I do believe you, Todd. 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
Leave, Mr. Keating. 

 

MR. NOLAN

 
But it wasn't his fault! 

TODD

 

 
Sit down, Mr. Anderson!

MR. NOLAN

 

Todd reluctantly returns to his seat.

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 

MR. NOLAN

 
One more outburst from you or anyone
else, and you're out of this school!
Leave, Mr. Keating.

Keating hesitates at the back of the classroom.

 
 

 
 

 
MR. NOLAN
I said leave, Mr. Keating.

 

Keating slowly turns and heads to the door. As he opens
it, Todd, stands upon his desk and turns to Keating.

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
O Captain! My Captain! 

TODD

 

 
Sit down, Mr. Anderson!

MR. NOLAN

 

Keating pauses at the door and looks back at Todd on his desk.

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 

MR. NOLAN

 
Do you hear me? Sit down! Sit down! This 
is your final warning, Anderson. How 
dare you? Do you hear me?

After a moment of indecision, Knox climbs up onto his desk.

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
O Captain! My Captain! 

KNOX

 

 
Mr. Overstreet, I warn you! Sit down!

MR. NOLAN

 

Pitts climbs up onto his desk, followed by several others,
including Meeks.

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 

MR. NOLAN

 
Sit down! Sit down. All of you. I want 
you seated. Sit down. Leave, Mr. 
Keating.

More students stand on their desks until half the class is standing.

 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 

 
All of you, down. I want you seated. Do 
you hear me? 

MR. NOLAN

 
 
Sit down! 

MR. NOLAN

Keating stands in the doorway, staring up at the boys in wonder. A
smile comes to his face.

 
 
   

 
 

 
Thank you, boys. Thank you.

KEATING
